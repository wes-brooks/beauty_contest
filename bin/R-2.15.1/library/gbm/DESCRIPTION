Description: This package implements extensions to Freund and
        Schapire's AdaBoost algorithm and Friedman's gradient boosting
        machine. Includes regression methods for least squares,
        absolute loss, quantile regression, logistic, Poisson, Cox
        proportional hazards partial likelihood, and AdaBoost
        exponential loss.
