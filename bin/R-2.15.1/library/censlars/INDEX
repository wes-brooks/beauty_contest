censReg_step            Use censReg to impute the censored values based
                        on the variables that were selected via the
                        LASSO.
censlars                Iterate between the censReg step and the lars
                        step in order to produce a final model.
censlars-package        The LASSO for linear regression with censored
                        observations ~~ package title ~~
initial_step            Get the intial coefficient estimates for all of
                        the predictor variables
lars_step               Uses the lars package to select variables based
                        on the imputed observations that come out of
                        the censReg step.
