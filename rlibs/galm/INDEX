evalBIC                 Evaluate the fitness of a genalg "chromosome"
galm                    Fit a linear model, using the genetic algorithm
                        for variable selection.
galm-package            What the package does (short line) Builds a
                        linear model using the genetic algorithm for
                        variable selection
monitor                 Monitor the process of the genetic algorithm by
                        printing a summary at each step.
predict.galm            Make predictions using a galm model
