evalBIC                 Evaluate the fitness of a genalg "chromosome"
galogistic              Fit a linear model, using the genetic algorithm
                        for variable selection.
galogistic-package      What the package does (short line) Builds a
                        linear model using the genetic algorithm for
                        variable selection
galogistic_monitor      Monitor the process of the genetic algorithm by
                        printing a summary at each step.
predict.galogistic      Make predictions using a galogistic model
