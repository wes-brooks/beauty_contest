The script to run the beauty contest calculations is code/beauty.py. It should be invoked this way (from within the python directory):
../bin/IronPython2.7/ipy.exe beauty.py

## Modules

 - `gbm` Gradient moosting machine
 - `pls` Partial least squares
 - `adapt` Adaptive lasso (for gaussian response)
 - `adalasso` Adaptive lasso (for logistic regression)
 - `galm` Genetic algorithm for gaussian response
 - `galogistic` Genetic algorithm for logistic regression
 - `spls` Sparse partial least squares (combines lasso and PLS)
