adalasso                Master function to use the adaptive lasso for
                        shrinkage and selection in a generalized linear
                        model
adalasso-package        Use the adaptive lasso for shrinkage and
                        selection in a generalized linear model
adaptive_step           The glm step (to get adaptive penalty weights)
                        for adaptive lasso shrinkage and selection in a
                        generalized linear model
lasso_step              The glmnet step (shrinks and selects model
                        coefficients) for adaptive lasso shrinkage and
                        selection in a generalized linear model
