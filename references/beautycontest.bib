To assess both the pollution rate and heterotrophic bacterial population in the lake water, samples were collected from 8 selected stations, 10 and 100 m far from the coast between the towns of Edremit and Zeve (approximately 20 km along the coast). Physico-chemical features (pH, temperature, dissolved O2, biochemical O2 demand, suspended solid matter, total solid matter) of the lake have also been measured. Water samples were inoculated on starch casein agar supplemented with cycloheximide (50 μg/ ml) and nystatine (50 μg/ml) to isolate actinomycetes, whereas nutrient agar and plate count agar technique were used to isolate the other microorganisms. The physico-chemical character of different water samples varied considerably. No actinomycetes were observed, but the total number of microorganisms was recorded to be 105 CFU ml-1 in some water samples. The most diverse and active bacterial populations were found in the samples collected from the outlet of a wastewater treatment plant. Although a huge rate of organic matter flows into the lake, the water samples are polluted to a lesser degree owing to high soda content and high pH. Overall, the prokaryotic communities in the highly alkaline Lake Van represent an interesting new example of gram +/- bacteria, well-adopted to a broad salinity range. But precaution should be taken into consideration as soon as possible to protect the east beach strip of Lake Van.},

	annote = {We evaluated the use of the PCR for detection of enteric viruses in groundwater. To do this, we used an improved sample-processing technique and a large-volume amplification protocol. The objective of this study was to use advanced molecular techniques to develop a rapid and simple method which can be used by the water industry for detection of viral contamination in a variety of water samples. The strategy described here fulfills the water industry's need for a rapid, reliable, easily performed method for analyzing groundwater for virus contamination. Viruses were detected after concentration from at least 400 gallons (1,512 liters) of water by a filter adsorption and elution method, which resulted in a concentrate containing viruses. A total of 150 samples were analyzed by performing cell culture assays for enteroviruses and by performing reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) analyses for enteroviruses, hepatitis A virus, and rotavirus. Thirteen samples (8.7%) produced cellular cytopathic effects when the Buffalo green monkey cell line was used. When primers specific for enteroviruses were used in RT-PCR, 40 of 133 samples (30.1%) tested positive for the presence of enterovirus RNA. When hepatitis A virus-specific primers were used, 12 of 139 samples (8.6%) were considered positive for the presence of hepatitis A viral RNA. The RT-PCR analysis performed with rotavirus-specific primers identified 18 of 130 samples (13.8%) that were positive for rotavirus RNA sequences. Our sampleprocessing technique and large-volume PCR protocol (reaction volume, 300 ml) resulted in sufficient removal or dilution of inhibitors so that more than 95% of the samples could be assayed by PCR. Because of its sensitivity for detecting viral nucleic acid sequences, PCR analysis should produce more positive results than cell culture analysis. Since either cell culture analysis or PCR can reveal only a ``snapshot'' of the quality of the groundwater being sampled, PCR seems to be a desirable rapid initial screening tool.},

Pseudomonas, yeast and mold count were performed for all sand samples as possible sand pollution indicators. Higher faecal indicators (both FC and FS) were obtained in sand rather than in water almost in all locations. The frequency of Salmonella and Vibrio isolation was also higher in sand than in water despite the fact that only 10 grams of sand were used while one liter of seawater was collected. Statistically significant correlations were found between faecal coliform and streptococci on one side of the beach and Salmonella and Vibrio on the other side.

The purpose of this study was to develop a 0.45 μm pore size dual membrane system, which can sequentially concentrate both viruses and bacteria. The top PVDF membrane was used to filter bacteria by physical straining while the bottom HA membrane retained viruses through adsorption. The recovery of this system was assessed using test organisms: enterococci and somatic coliphage. Volumes of 100 to 400 mL of unspiked and sewage-spiked beach water were filtered through both types of membranes. The PVDF membrane recovered statistically equivalent amounts of enterococci when compared to traditional membranes. All of the coliphage passed through the PVDF membrane, while 22{\%} passed through the HA membrane. Increasing the volume from 100 to 400 mL did not significantly influence recoveries. Up to 35{\%} of coliphage was eluted from the bottom membrane using beef extract solution. Rinsing bottom membranes with 0.5 mmol L -1 H2S04 was found to deactivate somatic coliphage. This research demonstrates the potential of using a dual membrane adsorption system for the concentration of both bacteria and viruses from recreational beaches. A proposed bi-layer filtration system can be designed for simultaneous bacteria and virus filtration. Future experiments should focus on measurements utilizing additional bacteria and viruses.

This study was an initial evaluation of the presence of indicator microbes and pathogens and the association among the indicator microbes, pathogens, and environmental conditions at a subtropical, recreational marine beach in south Florida impacted by non-point sources of pollution. Twelve water and eight sand samples were collected during four sampling events at high or low tide under elevated or reduced solar insolation conditions. The analyses performed included analyses of fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) (fecal coliforms, Escherichia coli, enterococci, and Clostridium perfringens), human-associated microbial source tracking (MST) markers (human polyomaviruses {$[$}HPyVs{$]$} and Enterococcus faecium esp gene), and pathogens (Vibrio vulnificus, Staphylococcus aureus, enterovirus, norovirus, hepatitis A virus, Cryptosporidium spp., and Giardia spp.). The enterococcus concentrations in water and sand determined by quantitative PCR were greater than the concentrations determined by membrane filtration measurement. The FIB concentrations in water were below the recreational water quality standards for three of the four sampling events, when pathogens and MST markers were also generally undetectable. The FIB levels exceeded regulatory guidelines during one event, and this was accompanied by detection of HPyVs and pathogens, including detection of the autochthonous bacterium V. vulnificus in sand and water, detection of the allochthonous protozoans Giardia spp. in water, and detection of Cryptosporidium spp. in sand samples. The elevated microbial levels were detected at high tide and under low-solar-insolation conditions. Additional sampling should be conducted to further explore the relationships between tidal and solar insolation conditions and between indicator microbes and pathogens in subtropical recreational marine waters impacted by non-point source pollution.},

Because fecal matter can be a major source of pathogens in ambient water, and because it is not practical or feasible to monitor for the full spectrum of all pathogens that may occur in water, water quality criteria are specified throughout the world in terms of fecal indicator organism densities. For decades, these fecal indicator organisms have served as surrogates for potential pathogens and subsequent health risks in both recreational and drinking waters. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) recommended recreational water quality criteria do not differentiate between fecal sources of pathogens. Thus, EPA's regulatory premise concerning recreational water quality has been that nonhuman-derived human pathogens in fecally contaminated waters are as hazardous as their human-derived counterparts. The World Health Organization's (WHO) recommended approach for classifying the water quality of recreational waters is based on the premise that the measure of microbiological indicators of fecal contamination can be "interpreted" using evidence of the presence or absence of human fecal contamination. This approach assumes that in general, sources other than human fecal contamination are less of a risk to human health. WHO indicated in their 2003 report Health Based Monitoring of Recreational Waters: The Feasibility of a New Approach (The "Annapolis Protocol") that "due to the species barrier, the density of pathogens of public health importance is generally assumed to be less in aggregate in animal excreta than in human excreta and may therefore represent a significantly lower risk to human health." Ultimately, the critical question is whether exposure to different fecal sources from recreational waters translates to significant differences in the risk of human infection or disease severity. The purpose of this white paper is to describe the existing knowledgebase available to characterize the relative risks of human illness from various sources of fecal contamination in recreational waters. Information related to human exposures to pathogens in fecally contaminated recreational and drinking waters was obtained by searching the scientific literature for epidemiological studies related to exposure to recreational waters and reports of outbreak investigations from both recreational and drinking waters.},

Water quality criteria are specified throughout the world in terms of concentrations of fecal indicator organisms because fecal matter can be a major source of pathogens in ambient water and because it is not practical or feasible to monitor for the full spectrum of all pathogens that may occur in water. For decades, these fecal indicator organisms have served as surrogates for potential pathogens and subsequent health risks in both recreational and drinking waters. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) currently recommends AWQC for recreational water that encompass all fecal sources that contain the relevant indicator species (enterococci and E. coli). This approach assumes that animal fecal material is as hazardous as human fecal material. There is limited evidence, however, that recreational water contaminated with animal fecal material is less risky to swimmers than recreational water contaminated with human fecal material. In order to evaluate the potential risks posed by animal fecal contamination, EPA is interested in understanding what human illnesses are caused by swimming in waters contaminated with animal fecal material ranging from wildlife sources to agricultural inputs. The animal species of most interest are the warm-blooded animals (mammals and birds) whose fecal material is detected by current indicators. The purpose of this white paper is to provide a summary of information on waterborne zoonotic pathogens that come primarily from warm-blooded animals, and which can be used to conceptualize potential risks from warm-blooded animal feces in ambient (untreated) recreational waters.},

	title = {GREAT LAKES BEACH SANITARY SURVEY USER MANUAL},
	month = {May 2008},
	annote = {Executive Summary The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) developed this Beach Sanitary Survey Tool as part of the 2004 Great Lakes Regional Collaboration (GLRC) to provide beach managers with a technically sound and consistent approach to identify pollution sources and share information. The beach sanitary survey provides a method for developing a documented historical record of beach and watershed water quality. It serves as a baseline to which future assessments of the overall health of the beach and watershed can be compared, and it enables beach managers to perform long-range water quality and resource planning. The tool will help beach managers collect and share pollutant data for watershed assessments, use the data in predictive models, and better enable them to remediate bacterial pollution sources to beaches. EPA developed two types of beach sanitary surveys----the Routine On-site Sanitary Survey and the Annual Sanitary Survey----to assist with short- and long-term beach assessments, respectively. The Routine On-site Sanitary Survey is performed at the same time that water quality samples are taken. It includes a form, which can be used to document the methods used to collect data during the Routine On-site Sanitary Survey. The Annual Sanitary Survey records information about factors in the surrounding watershed that might affect water quality at the beach. This survey includes, for example, information on septic tanks in the contributing watershed and land use information. Both surveys include forms to help document the information collected durin the survey. These forms are in paper and electronic format. EPA initially developed a draft Beach Sanitary Survey Tool in 2006. In the summer of 2007, the Beach Sanitary Survey Tool was tested at 61 beaches in the Great Lakes. The state and local governments testing the tool provided comments to EPA, who then used these comments to develop this final Beach Sanitary Survey Tool. For more information on the EPA Beach Program and on beach sanitary surveys, please contact: U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Water, BEACH Program (4305T), 1200 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW, Washington DC 20460.

The Beaches Environmental Assessment and Coastal Health Act (BEACH Act) requires EPA to develop and publish a list of discrete coastal recreation waters adjacent to beaches or similar points of access that are used by the public that specifies whether the waters are subject to a monitoring and notification program consistent with the National Beach Guidance and Required Performance Criteria for Grants (July 2002). This document, the National List of Beaches, fulfills this requirement. This list is primarily organized by state and county. For some territories and Hawaii, the beaches are listed by island. Alaska's beaches are reported by community. Beach names are listed with their monitoring status for the 2007 swimming season. We include only coastal and Great Lakes beaches in these lists. The list does not include beaches on inland waters because they are not subject to the BEACH Act. This document gives both EPA and the public a national picture of the extent of monitoring of beach waters, and it will help EPA determine how to better implement the BEACH Act.},

	annote = {The phylogenetic analysis of bacterial communities in environments receiving anthropogenic impact could help us to understand its effects and might be useful in the development of monitoring or management strategies. A study of the composition of 16S rDNA clone libraries prepared from bacterial communities in water samples from a marina and a beach on the coast of Mallorca (W. Mediterranean) was undertaken at two time points, corresponding to periods of maximum and minimum anthropogenic use of this area for nautical and recreational activities. Libraries generated from the marina were significantly different from those from the beach and a non-impacted, bay sample. In the marina, a predominance of sequence types was observed related to bacterioplankton from nutrient-enriched environments or typically associated with phytoplankton, such as certain phylotypes of the Roseobacter clade, OM60 clade and Bacteroidetes. Similar results were found in the summer beach library but not in the winter one, in which there was an increase in the number of clones from oligotrophic groups, in agreement with lower chlorophyll content and bacterial counts. Therefore, nutrient enrichment seemed to be an important driver of the composition of bacterial communities in sites receiving direct human impact. Interesting sequence types from the Cryomorphaceae and group agg58 (Bacteroidetes) were exclusively found in beach libraries, and the reasons for this distribution deserve further study. Clones related to putative hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria of the genus Acinetobacter were observed in the marina, in agreement with a certain degree of pollution at this site. Non-marine sequences belonging to the Actinobacteria predominated over marine groups in the summer library from the marina and, therefore, unusual communities might be transiently present in this enclosed environment. Overall, the composition of the bacterial communities in these environments agreed well with the defining characteristics of the environments sampled. {\copyright}2008 Elsevier GmbH.

The sewage spiked water samples were also tested for the concentrations of traditional fecal indicators (i.e., Escherichia coli, enterococci and Clostridium perfringens) and enteric viruses such as enteroviruses (EVs), sapoviruses (SVs), and torquetenoviruses (TVs). The overall host-specificity of the HS-HF183 marker to differentiate between humans and other animals was 98{\%}. However, the HS-esp, HS-AVs and HS-PVs showed 100{\%} host-specificity. All the human-specific markers showed >97{\%} sensitivity to detect human fecal pollution. E. coli, enterococci and, C. perfringens were detected up to dilutions of sewage 10−5, 10−4 and 10−3 respectively. HS-esp, HS-AVs, HS-PVs, SVs and TVs were detected up to dilution of sewage 10−4 whilst EVs were detected up to dilution 10−5. The ability of the HS-HF183 marker to detect fresh sewage was 3--4 orders of magnitude higher than that of the HS-esp and viral markers. The ability to detect fresh sewage in freshwater, seawater and distilled water matrices was similar for human-specific bacterial and viral marker. Based on our data, it appears that human-specific molecular markers are sensitive measures of fresh sewage pollution, and the HS-HF183 marker appears to be the most sensitive among these markers in terms of detecting fresh sewage. However, the presence of the HS-HF183 marker in environmental waters may not necessarily indicate the presence of enteric viruses due to their high abundance in sewage compared to enteric viruses. More research is required on the persistency of these markers in environmental water samples in relation to traditional fecal indicators and enteric pathogens.},

Four of the seven PCR-positive samples were also positive for one of the human-specific E. coli or enterococci BPTs. The results indicated human faecal pollution in the studied sub-catchments after storm events. LD and LI methods used in this study complimented each other and provided additional information regarding the polluting sources when one method failed to detect human faecal pollution.

	annote = {A large study of the distribution of Clostridium difficile in the environment of the Cardiff area of South Wales was performed with a methodology designed to maximise recovery. A total of 2580 samples was taken, with 184 (7.1{\%}) yielding isolates. The highest yield for C. difficile was obtained from river waters, with 14 (87.5{\%}) of 16 samples from four rivers positive, and from sea water samples with 7 (44{\%}) of 15 positive from six beaches on the Bristol Channel. In addition, 7 (46.7{\%}) of 15 samples of lake water were also positive. Twenty-two (21{\%}) of 104 soil samples, taken from random sites in Cardiff, were positive, as were 20{\%} of environmental samples from four Cardiff hospitals. C. difficile was also isolated from 50{\%} of eight swimming pool waters examined and 1 (5.5{\%}) of 18 of mains tap water. Carriage of C. difficile in 524 faecal samples of assorted farm animals was c. 1{\%}, and was 10{\%} in dogs and 2{\%} in cats. In private residences, the organism was present in 12 (2.2{\%}) of 550 samples. While 2.4{\%} of 300 raw vegetable samples were positive, none of 107 assorted fish gut contents was. These findings indicate that C. difficile may be more widely distributed in the general environment, particularly water, than was previously thought.},

In recent years, DNA fingerprinting has gained widespread application as a means to characterize genetic variations for such purposes as microbial source tracking. This approach, however, is strongly dependent on the statistical and image analyses applied. Several statistical analyses of rep- PCR DNA fingerprints were assessed as a means to differentiate between potential sources of fecal contamination. GelCompar II and methods based on penalized discriminant analysis (PDA) andk-nearest neighbors (KNN) classification procedures were used to differentiate between 10 source groups within a library containing DNA fingerprints of 548 Escherichia coli isolates from known human and nonhuman sources. KNN performed significantly better than PDA in a jackknife analysis, though the library was not large enough to detect significant differences between GelCompar II and the other two methods. GelCompar II and KNN both attained g90% correct classification in a holdout procedure. In addition, interpoint distance analyses indicate coherency within source groups, while library randomization demonstrated that KNN does not create artificial groupings. This investigation stresses the need to understand limitations of statistical analyses used in pattern recognition of DNA fingerprints.},

The study was prompted by an outbreak of waterborn viral illness shortly after the initial opening of a new restaurant in Plum Bottom. The tracer study looked for fast (months or less) connections between the new, professionally installed, conforming, tested and inspected septic system at the Log Den Restaurant and the Log Den water supply well, four down-gradient private wells and the regional karst groundwater system. The tracer study utilized the Log Den septic system as the tracer introduction points to look for additional evidence of rapid connection to the restaurant's water supply well and potential connections to a regional groundwater flow system. The study was funded through the Door County Soil and Water Conservation District and was conducted in September through December 2007.},

Design and Setting-This was a prospective survey carried out on Blackpool beach. Parents of children between the ages of 6 and 11 years were interviewed over a seven week period during July, August, and September, 1990. Respondents were followed up 10-14 d after the original interview by either telephone or post. Water samples were collected on each day of the survey. Participants-939 interviews with parents or guardians were completed on the beach; 857 (919{\%}) of these persons agreed to a follow up interview. The results of this study are based on 703 cases of matched data, of good quality, collected for each child on the beach and during a follow up interview. Main results-Non-compliance with the European Community microbiological imperative standards for recreational waters at Blackpool Tower and South Pier sampling sites, respectively, ranged between: 6{\%} and 7{\%} for total coliforms; 13{\%} and 25{\%} for faecal coliforms; 69{\%} and 80{\%} for faecal streptococci (Guide standard); 50{\%} and 67{\%} for salmonellae and 73{\%} and 88{\%} for enteroviruses. There was a significant overall increase in the mean number of symptoms reported for each child (p < 0.001). However, the prevalence of certain symptoms increased significantly only in those children who had been in contact with the water on the day of the beach interview. These symptoms included vomiting (p < 0.0009), diarrhoea (p<0.0001), itchy skin (p<0.0009), fever (p < 0.0013), lack of energy (p < 0.0007), and loss of appetite (p<0.0227). None of the other variables investigated could account for the significant increase in the reported symptom experience of those children in contact with sea water contaminated with sewage. Conclusions-children who come into contact with contaminated sea water are likely to develop symptoms as a result.},

Controlled releases were made of sanitary waste water and tracer dye mixtures.

An assessment was then made of the concentration of pollutants after discharge from Navy ships during normal operation. Seawater samples were collected from the wakes of ships in transit and from the water around ships anchored for an amphibious operation in the coastal zone. It was determined that pollutants discharged from the transiting ships were not measurable above background concentrations, and only slight coliform bacteria population increases were detected in the amphibious operations area. These increases were still well within those prescribed as safe for bathing beaches and fisheries. Findings of this study specifically refer to the Navy ships and the geographic locations involved.

	annote = {Recent investigations found high abundances of the fecal indicator Escherichia coli in shoreline sand at freshwater beaches, but it is not known whether these high numbers are due to passive filtration/trapping of the bacteria, or to colonization and growth. This study was initiated to test the hypothesis that high abundance can be explained, at least in part, by the ability of E. coli to persist and grow in beach sand. A combination of laboratory and field studies was used to monitor the densities of environmental isolates of E. coli in beach sand. In controlled laboratory microcosm studies using autoclaved beach sand inoculated with E. coli strains previously isolated from ambient beach sand, E. coli densities increased from 2 CFU/g to more than 2 ×105 CFU/g sand after 2 days of incubation at 79$\,^{\circ}$C, and remained above 2 ×105 CFU/g for at least 35 days. In field studies utilizing similarly inoculated beach sand in diffusion chambers incubated at a Lake Huron beach, E. coli also grew rapidly, reaching high densities (approximately 7.5 ×105 CFU/g), and persisting in a cultivable state at high density for at least 48 days. In comparison, E. coli levels in ambient beach sand adjacent to the chambers always had densities <100 CFU/g. Lake Huron beach sand clearly provides nutrients, temperatures, and other conditions needed to support growth of E. coli. The growth of E. coli in sterile sand diffusion chambers to higher levels than occurs in ambient beach sand may indicate the presence in ambient sand of biological controls on bacterial growth, such as predation or competition.},

It appears that the exclusive use of the faecal bacterial indicators underestimate the risk of infection posed by opportunistic pathogens like Aeromonas spp. and it is considered advisable to monitor these bacteria in recreational waters where the risk of direct infection to humans is high. Epidemiological studies are however needed to determine the relationship between cases of Aeromonas-associated diarrhoea and the densities of theses organisms in marine recreational waters. The present study demonstrates also that marine recreational waters contain a variety of campylobacters and when environmental contamination does occur, the effect of sewage effluent discharged into marine waters is important. Knowledge of the survival characteristics of thermophilic campylobacters in seawater is of prime importance. Further studies are needed to identify possible indicator organisms which could be used to predict the likely presence of Campylobacter spp. in sewage polluted seawater. Data from this investigation provide information of seasonal occurrence of thermophilic campylobacters in marine waters and identification of the periods of greatest health hazard. However epidemiological studies are needed to elucidate the public health significance of campylobacters in marine recreational waters.},

	title = {Environmental study of the alternatives for the sewer system of a small coastal community in the Bay of Biscay},
	annote = {Zumaia is a small tourist community on the northern coast of Spain, situated along the estuary of the Urola river. This ecosystem has been affected by urban discharges coming from the villages surrounding the estuary. According to the 91/271 European Community Directive, regarding wastewater treatment, this situation should be addressed in order to achieve the quality objectives established for the restoration of the natural values of the area. The local Water Authorities of the Basque Country (Spain) have adopted an integrated model for the design of the sewer system of this community. The model was developed specifically for the study of coastal sewerage under dominant wet weather conditions and includes: 1) Establishment of the site specific statutory requirements and environmental objectives; 2) Design of sewer system components with specific reference to influences on marine water quality; 3) Development of monitoring programs. The construction of a sewer pipe alongside the river to collect the foul and the stormwater flow will prevent a large proportion of the discharges of contaminants into the receiving waters. However, the presence of overflows in the system during storms leads to the release of a great deal of pollutants into these waters. The main problems related to this type of discharge in the littoral zone arise from the bacteriological contamination of the bathing waters and from the oxygen depletion over the estuary. These two topics have been the predominant issues conditioning the consideration of different schemes of management of the sewer system. The aim of this paper is to analyze, from an environmental point of view, the structural and functional scheme considered for the sewage management of this community.},

The study area comprehends 17 beaches of the Caraguatatuba Bay and the Channel of S{\~a}o Sebasti{\~a}o. The data about the macrobenthos were collected from March, 1988 to March, 1991 and the data on bathing conditions came from reports published by CETESB. The biological samples were obtained with an iron core of 0.025 m2 surface area. The results show markedly the presence of species considered as indicators of organically enriched places, such as Capitella capitata, Heteromastus filiformis, Laeonereis acuta, and Scolelepis squamata. The high density of Capitella and Heteromastus in beaches considered improper for bathing consist in a strong indication of the degree of damage to these areas.},

These bacteria are used in microbial source tracking (MST) studies, which attempt to assess the contribution of various host species to fecal pollution in water. Ideally, all strains of a given indicator organism (IO) would experience equal persistence (maintenance of culturable populations) in water; however, some strains may have comparatively extended persistence outside the host, while others may persist very poorly in environmental waters. Assessment of the relative contribution of host species to fecal pollution would be confounded by differential persistence of strains. Here, freshwater and saltwater mesocosms, including sediments, were inoculated with dog feces, sewage, or contaminated soil and were incubated under conditions that included natural stressors such as microbial predators, radiation, and temperature fluctuations. Persistence of IOs was measured by decay rates (change in culturable counts over time). Decay rates were influenced by IO, inoculum, water type, sediment versus water column location, and Escherichia coli strain. Fecal coliform decay rates were significantly lower than those of enterococci in freshwater but were not significantly different in saltwater. IO persistence according to mesocosm treatment followed the trend: contaminated soil > wastewater > dog feces. E. coli ribotyping demonstrated that certain strains were more persistent than others in freshwater mesocosms, and the distribution of ribotypes sampled from mesocosm waters was dissimilar from the distribution in fecal material. These results have implications for the accuracy of MST methods, modeling of microbial populations in water, and efficacy of regulatory standards for protection of water quality.},

In order to perform the goals mentioned above, the Italian side has identified some test sites mainly in the Tuscany region and the data from the following optical sensors of the PRIRODA module will be utilized: (1) ISTOK-1 - the instrument is a 64 channel infrared spectro-radiometer in the band of 4 to 16 micrometers. (2) MOS-OBZOR - this imaging spectrometer is dedicated to the investigation of the reflected solar radiation in the visible and near infrared. (3) OZON-M - the instrument is suitable to the investigation of the spatial structure of the infrared radiation of the ocean surface and the atmosphere. (4) MSU-E - this electro-optical scanner operates at a spatial resolution of 25 m in three visible and near infrared spectral bands. (5) MSU-SK - this opto-mechanical scanner operates in four adjacent visible and near infrared bands at 120 m of spatial resolution plus one band in the thermal infrared region with 300 m of spatial resolution. Taking into account the characteristics of these sensors and utilizing both experimental data available now and coming from similar sensors placed on aircraft or spacecraft and suitable models, we are estimating the possible applications of such new sensors.},

	annote = {Since the commissioning of the three major deepwater outfalls in Sydney, there has been a dramatic improvement in general beach water quality at Sydney's ocean beaches. This has required the NSW Environment Protection Authority's Beachwatch Programme to shift from assessing the impacts of gross sewage pollution due to nearshore outfalls to more diffuse pollution from stormwater and sewer overflows. The visual indicators of gross sewage pollution originally used by Beachwatch for the daily assessment of bacterial water quality are now of limited value. General linear models (with multiple effects) were constructed to identify the secondary indicators which best describe the levels of bacterial contamination due to stormwater pollution. Data from four representative Sydney beaches were modelled separately due to the site-specific effects of pollution sources and hydrodynamics. Factors which were built into the models and were known on the day of prediction were rain amount, presence of stormwater material, the maximum daily stormwater rating, drain or lagoon flows at the time of sampling, and the drain/lagoon bacterial concentration two days before sampling. Results indicate that there is a general linear relationship between visual indicators and bacterial density; however, the reliability of the prediction on a daily basis is poor and rainfall alone as a predictor is equivalent to or better than visual assessment alone. The primary source of information for the preparation of Beachwatch daily pollution bulletins now is rainfall reports from a telemetered network of rain gauges along the coast. This is a more cost-effective approach and has allowed the reallocation of resources to address more directly the problem of stormwater pollution at higher risk beaches.},

These waters differed significantly in their heavy metal contents as well as nutrient and bacterial grazer concentrations. Grazing and other biological factors were studied using filtered (3 and 0.2 Wm) and autoclaved water. The survival of E. coli O157:H7 was primarily decreased by elevated copper concentrations. This hypothesis was supported by acute toxicity assay data. In addition, significant protozoan predation effects were observed in untreated water when compared with survival rates in filtered water. The combination of these two factors in particular determines the survival time of the pathogen in a private water well. It therefore appears that wells with higher water quality as assessed using the European Union Drinking Water Directive standards will also allow survival of E. coli O157:H7 for much longer periods.},

Daily enterococci counts were predicted by rainfall (>10 mm in 24 h or >5 mm over 4-5 days), or by wind direction/speed, sunlight and tide during dry periods. Quantitative microbial risk assessment models (maximum risk exponential model for gastroenteritis and adenovirus exponential model for respiratory illness) fitted the United Kingdom epidemiological data and show potential for use. Flexibility in interpreting what is important for local conditions is essential, illustrated by replacing the general descriptions in the Farnham report with more ridged values for stormwater-impacted beaches. Hence, a user-friendly format for bather risk management, based on key environmental predictors of faecal pollution (such as rainfall, wind direction and tide) should largely replace the need for regular and costly microbiological testing; providing risk estimates in real time and allowing immediate control measures, such as signage or temporary beach closures. Ongoing testing resources should be directed to understanding the source(s) of faecal contamination, comparing enterococci/enteric virus survival under warm Australian conditions and spot checks for recalibration of environmental factors.},

The Meteorological Service of Canada, Environment Canada, provided an analysis and testimony to the Walkerton Inquiry on the excessive rainfall events, including an assessment of the historical significance and expected return periods of the rainfall amounts. While the onset of the majority of the Walkerton, Ontario, Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Campylobacter outbreak occurred several days after a heavy rainfall on May 12, the accumulated 5-d rainfall amounts from 8-12 May were particularly significant. These 5-d accumulations could, on average, only be expected once every 60 yr or more in Walkerton and once every 100 yr or so in the heaviest rainfall area to the south of Walkerton. The significant link between excess rainfall and waterborne disease outbreaks, in conjunction with other multiple risk factors, indicates that meteorological and climatological conditions need to be considered by water managers, public health officials, and private citizens as a significant risk factor for water contamination. A system to identify and project the impacts of such challenging or extreme weather conditions on water supply systems could be developed using a combination of weather/climate monitoring information and weather prediction or quantitative precipitation forecast information. The use of weather monitoring and forecast information or a "wellhead alert system" could alert water system and water supply managers on the potential response of their systems to challenging weather conditions and additional requirements to protect health. Similar approaches have recently been used by beach managers in parts of the United States to predict day-to-day water quality for beach advisories.},

We used flowing freshwater mesocosms to explore the effect of submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) on the persistence of natural enterococci populations from a subtropical lake. The highest mean densities of culturable enterococci over 2 weeks occurred in SAV {$[$}8.6 ×102 colony-forming units (cfu) per 100 g wet weight{$]$}, followed by sediments (1.3 ×102 cfu per 100 g) and water (18 cfu per 100 ml). However, due to relative differences in the total mass of each substrate in the entire system (water > sediments > SAV), SAV-associated enterococci represented only a minor proportion of the total population. Vegetated mesocosms harboured significantly higher mean cfu per mesocosm and cfu densities in sediments compared with their unvegetated counterparts, suggesting that SAV indirectly facilitates persistence in aquatic habitats. Populations were dominated (> 96{\%}) by a single Enterococcus casseliflavus strain according to BOX-PCR genotyping, which did not change over the 10-month study and strongly suggests bacterial replication in the lake. The presence of such strains in the environment may represent highly competitive, naturalized and reproducing indicator bacteria populations that are not directly related to pollution events.},

The previously validated Bacteroidales assays BacUni-UCD, BacHum-UCD, BacCow-UCD, and BacCan-UCD were utilized to determine concentrations of Bacteroidales genetic markers targeting all warm-blooded animals, humans, cows and dogs, specifically, over a period of 24 d. Microcosms containing mixed feces in dialysis tubing were exposed to seawater under flow-through conditions at ambient temperature in the presence and absence of sunlight. Using a two-stage plus linear decay model, the average T99 (two-log reduction) of host-specific Bacteroidales cells was 28 h, whereas that of host-specific Bacteroidales DNA was 177 h. Natural sunlight did not affect the survival of uncultivable Bacteroidales cells and their DNA with the exception of the BacCow-UCD marker. Bacteroidales DNA, as measured by quantitative PCR (qPCR) without PMA, persisted for as long as 24 d at concentrations close to the limit of detection. Culturable Enterococcus cells were detected for only 70 h, whereas Enterococcus cells measured by qPCR with and without PMA persisted for 450 h. In conclusion, measuring Bacteroidales DNA without differentiating between intact and dead cells or extracellular DNA may misinform about the extent of recent fecal pollution events, particularly in the case of multiple sources of contamination with variable temporal and spatial scales due to the relatively long persistence of DNA in the environment. In contrast, applying qPCR with and without PMA can provide data on the fate and transport of fecal Bacteroidales in water, and help implement management practices to protect recreational water quality.},

The formed pellets were originally misidentified as being from pigs or humans, and therefore were perceived as a pollutant of potential health hazard to humans. However, bacteriological analysis of the nearshore waters indicated low and legally acceptable levels of faecal coliforms and enterococci. Similar diminished levels were also found in direct cultures of the fresh pellets. Green turtle faeces have been known to drift ashore in Hawaii, but never in the quantities recorded during this short-term event. The reason for the occurrence could not be determined, but several possible explanations are given.},

No single one of the indicators tested to date has been able to determine the source of fecal pollution in water. However, the combined use of different indicators has been demonstrated to be the best way of defining predictive models suitable for determining fecal pollution sources. Molecular methods are promising tools that could complement standard microbiological water analysis. In this study, the feasibility of some proposed molecular indicators for microbial source tracking (MST) was compared (names of markers are in parentheses): host-specific Bacteroidetes (HF134, HF183, CF128, and CF193), Bifidobacterium adolescentis (ADO), Bifidobacterium dentium (DEN), the gene esp of Enterococcus faecium, and host-specific mitochondrial DNA associated with humans, cattle, and pigs (Humito, Bomito, and Pomito, respectively). None of the individual molecular markers tested enabled 100{\%} source identification. They should be combined with other markers to raise sensitivity and specificity and increase the number of sources that are identified. MST predictive models using only these molecular markers were developed. The models were evaluated by considering the lowest number of molecular indicators needed to obtain the highest rate of identification of fecal sources. The combined use of three molecular markers (ADO, Bomito, and Pomito) enabled correct identification of 75.7{\%} of the samples, with differentiation between human, swine, bovine, and poultry sources. Discrimination between human and nonhuman fecal pollution was possible using two markers: ADO and Pomito (84.6{\%} correct identification). The percentage of correct identification increased with the number of markers analyzed. The best predictive model for distinguishing human from nonhuman fecal sources was based on 5 molecular markers (HF134, ADO, DEN, Bomito, and Pomito) and provided 90.1{\%} correct classification.},

These data are part of the continuing effort of the U.S. Geological Survey Toxic Substances Hydrology Program to collect baseline information on the environmental occurrence of pharmaceuticals and other organic wastewater contaminants. In 2000, samples were collected from 47 ambient ground-water sites (not drinking-water wells) in 18 states and analyzed for 65 organic wastewater contaminants. In the summer of 2001, samples were collected from 74 sources of raw, untreated, drinking water in 25 states and Puerto Rico and analyzed for 100 organic wastewater contaminants. These sources comprise 25 ground-water and 49 surface-water sources of drinking water serving populations ranging from one family to more than 8 million people. Site selection for both studies focused on areas known or suspected to contain sources of animal and/or human wastewater. The five most frequently detected compounds in samples collected from ambient ground-water sites are N,N-diethyltoluamide (35 percent, insect repellant), bisphenol A (30 percent, plasticizer), tri(2-chloroethy) phosphate (30 percent, fire retardant), sulfamethoxazole (23 percent, veterinary and human antibiotic), and 4-octylphenol monoethoxylate (19 percent, detergent metabolite). The five most frequently detected organic wastewater contaminants in samples of untreated drinking water from surface-water sources are cholesterol (59 percent, natural sterol), metolachlor (53 percent, herbicide), cotinine (51 percent, nicotine metabolite), B -sitosterol (37 percent, natural plant sterol), and 1,7-dimethylxanthine (27 percent, caffeine metabolite). The five most frequently detected organic wastewater contaminants in samples of untreated drinking water from ground-water sources are tetrachloroethylene (24 percent, solvent), carbamazepine (20 percent, pharmaceutical), bisphenol A (20 percent, plasticizer), 1,7-dimethylxanthine (16 percent, caffeine metabolite), and tri(2-chloroethyl) phosphate (12 percent, fire retardant).},

The commonest microbiological tests done on water are for coliforms and Escherichia coli (or faecal coliform). This paper reviews the legislative and other guidance for microbial standards in drinking and bathing waters and considers evidence for the relationship between the microbiological quality of water and risk to human health. In the past measures of the microbiological quality of water correlated well with risks of acquiring gastrointestinal disease. More recent work suggests that gastrointestinal disease is more strongly associated with the presence of enterococci than of E. coli. New diseases such as cryptosporidiosis have been shown to cause outbreaks of waterborne disease when levels of conventional microbiological parameters are satisfactory. In response to this, and because of failure of prosecution in one outbreak, the United Kingdom (UK) Government has introduced new legislation that requires water providers to perform a risk assessment on their water treatment facilities and to implement continuous monitoring for cryptosporidium. A new European directive on drinking water has been introduced and legislation on cryptosporidium in drinking water has been proposed in the UK.},

	annote = {An N-PLS regression technique was tested as an empirical downscaling method. Average monthly near-ground air temperature (t), specific humidity (q), and sea-level pressure (P) fields across Central and Western Europe were used as predictors for average monthly air temperature (T), dew temperature (D), and precipitation amount (P) at 4 locations in Slovenia. The empirical downscaling models (EM) were developed by means of available predictand data from the ARSO archive and predictor data from the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis project, for the period 1951-2002, separately for single months. Using the combination of t and p as predictors, the EM for T explained from 73{\%} to 95{\%} of predictand variability, for D from 74{\%} to 97{\%} of predictand variability, and for P from 31{\%} to 76{\%} of predictand variability. The use of q as an additional predictor did not improve the quality of the EM considerably. Developed EM using p and t as predictors were applied to the results of 5 general circulation models (GCM): CSIRO/Mk2, CCC/CGCM2, UKMO/HadCM3, DOE-NCAR/PCM, and MPI-DMI/ECHAM4-OPYC3. Only the simulations based on SRES A2 and B2 emission scenarios were considered in our calculations. Available mean monthly values of predictors for the period 1951-2100 were used. All the projections of GCM results indicate an increase in T and D and decrease in P in the 21(st) century at all 4 locations. The expected range of changes in T, D, and P is wide due to the different response of GCM to identical changes in the atmospheric composition, and represents a source of uncertainty in empirical downscaling results. Another important source of uncertainty in empirical downscaling studies, especially when temperature dependent predictors are used, is the problem of extrapolation. By using the proper mathematical approach for EM development we only reduce a part of the uncertainty related to the quality of empirical models that also strongly depend on the quality of input data and predictor selection. The N-PLS regression seems to be a suitable choice of mathematical method, as the feature selection from a large number of predictor time series is not predictand independent. Finally, any climate change and impact studies for the future are affected by many other uncertainties that we have to be fully aware of, while interpreting their results.}

Thus, PCR assays targeting the tpi gene were developed to detect specifically these three G. duodenalis assemblages. Assemblages A and B were detected in urban wastewater with a predominance of assemblage A, especially for one treatment plant. Concerning slaughterhouse wastewater, assemblage A was found in 58{\%} of the samples, whereas assemblage B was not detected. Assemblage E was not detected in urban wastewater, but was found in 92{\%} of the samples from slaughterhouse. Thus, combination of assemblages A and B seemed to indicate a human contamination origin, while combination of assemblages A and E appeared to correspond to a livestock contamination origin.},

Particulate absorption measured using the quantitative filter technique yielded absorption spectra containing a fraction that could not be attributed to phytoplankton pigments, living heterotrophs, mineral sediments, or organic detritus but were indicative of additional absorption by a fraction of dissolved organic matter present in colloidal and/or particle-bound form. Erroneously high phytoplankton absorption coefficients measured at short wavelengths using the filter technique suggested that this particle-bound DOM is removed along with phytoplankton pigments during bleaching by sodium hypochlorite and as such is mistakenly incorporated into the phytoplankton absorption signal. Observations suggest that the selective sorption of fractions of DOM onto suspended particles may be responsible for significant variability in the absorption coefficients of particulate and dissolved matter and may be an important contributor to the total spectral absorption signals in Lake Erie waters. This reservoir of coloured organic matter, which to date has not been seriously considered in the optical properties of coastal and inland waters, may produce significant uncertainties in the parameterization of optical models and the interpretation of in situ and remotely sensed aquatic colour signals.

The study focusses on the bacterial and pathogenic contamination of recreational water by cottages and boats. Five indicator microorganisms: 1) fecal coliforms, 2) Escherichia coli, 3) fecal streptococcus, 4) enterococci, and 5) Pseudomonas aeruginosa, were measured in the surface water and bottom sediment for ten (10) weeks in accordance with Federal, Provincial and US E.P.A. Guidelines for Recreational Water Quality and Provincial Water Quality Objectives. Accumulation of bacteria in the bottom sediment and subsequent upwelling to the surface water is presented and the correlation of this reintroduction, with wind velocity and direction, is discussed. A correlation between the number of boats with human waste facilities and bacteria and dissolved organic carbon in the surface water is presented and the effect of the water exchange rate (as represented by fetch) is discussed. Some interim conclusions and recommendations are presented. These recommendations include the need for both ongoing sampling, testing and analysis and improved regulations and enforcement for the safe retention and disposal of human waste from both cottages and boats.},

Isolated previous determinations of water quality in the beaches showed presence of faecal coliforms in concentrations above those admitted by Venezuelan standards for beach water (200 to 400 org/100 ml) being attributed their presence to the percolation of sewage from the septic tanks of the community (there is no sewerage). However, in the Park there are abundant birds and they could be the principal cause of the coliform presence. Based on these assumptions research was conducted to determine the influence of birds in the bacteriological quality of the beach water, and to evaluate it four distinctive sampling zones were chosen: a) only human presence; b) only birds presence; c) human and birds presence and d) no presence of humans or birds as blank. Coliform and other species were determined in every one of the zones and results showed that septic tanks were not the cause of a significant presence of Coliforms because temporary and seasonal variability was related to activity and presence of birds in the National Park. Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonias and Enterobacter cloacae were the predominant species in the birds shelter zone as well as in the human presence, being their density and relationship with the physical surroundings the factors that allowed to define the origin of these pollution indicators. It is necessary to continue research in order to find a microbiological indicator that may discriminate the origin of these organisms in protected areas with abundance of birds and answer the question: ¿Are they indicators of human caused pollution?},

	title = {Enterococci concentrations in diverse coastal environments exhibit extreme variability},
	annote = {Fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) concentrations in a single grab sample of water are used to notify the public about the safety of swimming in coastal waters. If concentrations are over a single-sample standard, waters are closed or placed under an advisory. Previous work has shown that notification errors occur often because FIB vary more quickly than monitoring results can be obtained (typically 24 h). Rapid detection technologies (such as quantitative polymerase chain reaction) that allow FIB quantification in hours have been suggested as a solution to notification errors. In the present study, I explore variability of enterococci (ENT) over time scales less than a day that might affect interpretation of FIB concentrations from a single grab sample, even if obtained rapidly. Five new data sets of ENT collected at 10 and 1 min periodicities for 24 and 1 h, respectively, are presented. Data sets are collected in diverse marine environments from a turbulent surf zone to a quiescent bay. ENT vary with solar and tidal cycles, as has been observed in previous studies. Over short time scales, ENT are extremely variable in each environment even the quiescent bay. Changes in ENT concentrations between consecutive samples (1 or 10 min apart) greater than the single-sample standard (104 most probable number per 100 mL) are not unusual. Variability, defined as the change in concentration between consecutive samples, is not distinct between environments. ENT change by 60{\%} on average between consecutive samples, and by as much as 700{\%}. Spectral analyses reveal no spectral peaks, but power-law decline of spectral density with frequency. Power-law exponents are close to 1 suggesting ENT time series share properties with 1/f noise and are fractal in nature. Since fractal time series have no characteristic time scale associated with them, it is not obvious how the fractal nature of ENT can be exploited for adaptive sampling or management. Policy makers, as well as scientists designing field campaigns for microbial source tracking and epidemiology studies, are cautioned that a single sample of water reveals little about the true water quality at a beach. Multiple samples must be taken to gain a snapshot into the patchy structure of microbial water quality and associated human health risk. {\copyright}2007 American Chemical Society.},

The purpose of the study was to compare methods for extraction of faecal bacteria from sands and recommend a standardized extraction technique. Methods and Results: Twenty-two methods of extracting enterococci and Escherichia coli from sand were evaluated, including multiple permutations of hand shaking, mechanical shaking, blending, sonication, number of rinses, settling time, eluant-to-sand ratio, eluant composition, prefiltration and type of decantation. Tests were performed on sands from California, Florida and Lake Michigan. Most extraction parameters did not significantly affect bacterial enumeration. anova revealed significant effects of eluant composition and blending; with both sodium metaphosphate buffer and blending producing reduced counts. Conclusions: The simplest extraction method that produced the highest FIB recoveries consisted of 2 min of hand shaking in phosphate-buffered saline or deionized water, a 30-s settling time, one-rinse step and a 10 : 1 eluant volume to sand weight ratio. This result was consistent across the sand compositions tested in this study but could vary for other sand types. Significance and Impact of the Study: Method standardization will improve the understanding of how sands affect surface water quality.},

	annote = {An analytical model of enterococci (ENT) concentrations in the surf zone of a long sandy beach is constructed considering the physical processes of dilution by rip currents and alongshore littoral drift, and the biological processes of inactivation and mortality by grazing. The solution is used to construct an expression for the length of shoreline adversely impacted by ENT from a point source. Two non-dimensional parameters are developed whose magnitude can be used to ascertain whether dilution, inactivation, or grazing is the dominant sink for ENT in the surf zone. The model is applied to beaches in southern California, USA. Model input parameters related to physical processes and inactivation are compiled from the literature. Laboratory experiments are conducted to determine grazing mortality rates of ENT (6.5×10 -6s-1). Results indicate that at the field sites, between 1000 and 5000 m of shoreline are typically impacted by a continuous point source of ENT. Dilution is the primary cause of decline in ENT concentrations within the surf zone, with inactivation secondary and grazing tertiary. Results recommend strategic positioning of point sources and timing of effluent releases to take advantage of high dilution conditions. Our estimates for grazing mortality rates are within the same order of magnitude as some published inactivation rates, thus we cannot rule out the possibility that grazing is an important sink for ENT, especially in low dilution environments like enclosed bays. {\copyright}2005 Elsevier Ltd.

During summer, cooler than average waters caused by interannual variability in sea surface temperature (SST), synoptic upwelling, and tidal-period cooling are coincident with elevated levels of microbial pollution in the surf zone. This relationship can be explained by the effects of weakening in stratification on the fate of a waste water plume and the prolonged persistence of fecal indicator bacteria in colder waters. During winter, warmer than average water caused by basin scale oscillations and atmospheric and oceanographic processes that contribute to the Multivariate El Nino Southern Oscillation Index are indicative of elevated total coliform levels in the surf zone. The elevated coliform levels can be ascribed to increased rainfall, and the resultant storm water inflow to the surf zone. Copyright 2004 by the American Geophysical Union.},

	annote = {The coastal, unconfined aquifer at Huntington Beach, California contains saline groundwater (33 psu) adjacent to the water line, and a brackish groundwater (BGW) mixing zone (3--9 psu) approximately 50m from the water line. According to salinity and water isotope analyses, the BGW composition varies spatially in the alongshore direction. Measurements obtained from two BGW wells indicate this water is a mixture of seawater and a freshwater end member (likely infiltrated runoff); results from a third more southerly well suggest the BGW is composed of seawater, freshwater, and water from the confined Talbert Aquifer. Saline groundwater, on the other hand, shares similar salinity and water isotopic composition with seawater. The saline groundwater is enriched with short- and long-lived radium isotopes relative to the surf zone, which in turn is enriched relative to waters further offshore. We derive eddy diffusion coefficients for the nearshore using 223Ra and 224Ra, and in conjunction with 226Ra activities, estimate a submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) rate between 4.2 and 8.9 L min-1m-1 of shoreline, respectively. Using analytical models, we estimate that between 74 and 100% of this discharge represents seawater than has been forced by tides and waves through the beach aquifer. Under one set of model assumptions, results indicate that a portion (up to 56%) of seawater pumped into the beach aquifer by waves and tides is not discharged suggesting salt water intrusion may be occurring. Because saline groundwater is enriched with dissolved inorganic nitrogen and soluble reactive phosphate relative to the coastal ocean, our results suggest that tidally and wave-driven seawater circulated through the beach aquifer represents an important mechanism for nutrient input to the nearshore environment in dry weather. Estimates of nutrient flux to the coastal ocean via SGD along 16--17km of shoreline are equivalent to nutrient fluxes from two salt water wetlands near the study site during the dry season.},

Additionally, little is known about photoinactivation of other fecal indicators and human viruses in recreational waters. We sampled nearshore waters at Avalon Beach, California hourly for 72 h for reactive oxygen species (ROS), traditional indicator bacteria (E. coli and enterococci, and QPCR-based detection of enterococci), F+ (DNA and RNA) and somatic coliphages, the human-specific marker in Bacteroidales (HF marker), human enterovirus, and human adenovirus. E. coli and enterococci (regardless of measurement technique) covaried with each other and the coliphages suggesting similar sources and fates. The occurrence of the HF and enterovirus markers was correlated, but their occurrence was not positively correlated with the other indicators. Lower concentrations or occurrence of all microbes, excluding the HF and enterovirus markers, were observed during sunlit as opposed to dark hours, pointing to the importance of photoinactivation. Empirical-deterministic models for a subset of microbial indicators were created to determine field-relevant sunlight inactivation rates while accounting for time dependent sources and sinks. Photoinactivation rates of enterococci and E. coli, enterococci measured by QPCR, and somatic coliphage were estimated at 7, 6, 3, and 28 d−1 I−1, respectively, where I is UVB intensity in W/m2. Average H2O2 was 183 nM and the maximum singlet oxygen steady state concentration was 6.6 fM. Given the clarity of the water, direct genomic damage of bacteria and coliphage, as well as indirect endogenous damage of bacteria, were likely the most important inactivation mechanisms, but we cannot rule out a contribution by indirect mechanisms involving the H2O2 and singlet oxygen produced exogenously.},

	annote = {Surveillance of zoonotic pathogens in marine birds and mammals in the Northwest Atlantic revealed a diversity of zoonotic agents. We found amplicons to sequences from Brucella spp., Leptospira spp., Giardia spp. and Cryptosporidium spp. in both marine mammals and birds. Avian influenza was detected in a harp seal and a herring gull. Routine aerobic and anaerobic culture showed a broad range of bacteria resistant to multiple antibiotics. Of 1460 isolates, 797 were tested for resistance, and 468 were resistant to one or more anti-microbials. 73{\%} (341/468) were resistant to 1-4 drugs and 27{\%} (128/468) resistant to 5-13 drugs. The high prevalence of resistance suggests that many of these isolates could have been acquired from medical and agricultural sources and inter-microbial gene transfer. Combining birds and mammals, 45{\%} (63/141) of stranded and 8{\%} (2/26) of by-caught animals in this study exhibited histopathological and/or gross pathological findings associated with the presence of these pathogens. Our findings indicate that marine mammals and birds in the Northwest Atlantic are reservoirs for potentially zoonotic pathogens, which they may transmit to beachgoers, fishermen and wildlife health personnel. Conversely, zoonotic pathogens found in marine vertebrates may have been acquired via contamination of coastal waters by sewage, run-off and agricultural and medical waste. In either case these animals are not limited by political boundaries and are therefore important indicators of regional and global ocean health. {\copyright}Inter-Research 2008.},

Results showed that the concentrations of indicators of faecal contamination, whether within or over the values established by legislation, are not always related to the presence and density of microorganisms of environmental origin but the regression models used can help to describe how these latter microorganisms can be in relation to levels of the parameters.

However, samples of sand from the surf zone and upper beach are not monitored which is surprising since sand may accumulate and harbor fecal-derived organisms. This study examined the prevalence of fecal indicator organisms in tidally-affected beach sand and in upper beach sand and compared these counts to levels in the water. Since indicator organisms were statistically elevated in sand relative to water, the study also considered the potential health risks associated with beach use and exposure to sand. Fecal coliforms, Escherichia coli, enterococci, somatic coliphages, and F+-specific coliphages were enumerated from sand and water at three South Florida beaches (Ft. Lauderdale Beach, Hollywood Beach, and Hobie Beach) over a 2-year period. Bacteria were consistently more concentrated in 100 g samples of beach sand (2-23 fold in wet sand and 30-460 fold in dry sand) compared to 100 ml samples of water. Somatic coliphages were commonly recovered from both sand and water while F+-specific coliphages were less commonly detected. Seeding experiments revealed that a single specimen of gull feces significantly influenced enterococci levels in some 3.1 m2 of beach sand. Examination of beach sand on a micro-spatial scale demonstrated that the variation in enterococci density over short distances was considerable. Results of multiple linear regression analysis showed that the physical and chemical parameters monitored in this study could only minimally account for the variation observed in indicator densities. A pilot epidemiological study was conducted to examine whether the length of exposure to beach water and sand could be correlated with health risk. Logistic regression analysis results provided preliminary evidence that time spent in the wet sand and time spent in the water were associated with a dose-dependent increase in gastrointestinal illness. {\copyright}2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Twenty-four Acanthamoeba strains were isolated from beach sand (n = 20), soil (n = 3), and tap water (n = 1) in south Florida. Phylogenetic analysis identified 19 of 24 isolates as T4, the Acanthamoeba keratitis-associated genotype. The remaining isolates were genotype T5 (4) and T11 (1). Nearly all beach isolates were genotype T4, whereas the tap water and soil isolates were mostly T5. All amoebae grew at 0, 1.0, and 2.0{\%} salt and 19 of 20 beach isolates also grew at 3.2{\%}. No soil or tapwater acanthamoebae reproduced at 3.2{\%}. All isolates grew at 37$\,^{\circ}$C and two (T5) at 42$\,^{\circ}$C. Little correlation existed between beach location, salt-tolerance, and genetic relatedness. Overall, the large majority of environmental isolates obtained were genotype T4, suggesting it may be the most common genotype in this environment and could be a potential source of Acanthamoeba keratitis infections.},

	annote = {The largest reported outbreak of waterborne Escherichia coli O157:H7 in the United States occurred in upstate New York following a county fair in August 1999. Culture methods were used to isolate E. coli O157:H7 from specimens from 128 of 775 patients with suspected infections. Campylobacter jejuni was also isolated from stools of 44 persons who developed diarrheal illness after attending this fair. There was one case of a confirmed coinfection with E. coli O157:H7 and C. jejuni. Molecular detection of stx1 and stx2 Shiga toxin genes, immunomagnetic separation (IMS), and selective culture enrichment were utilized to detect and isolate E. coli O157:H7 from an unchlorinated well and its distribution points, a dry well, and a nearby septic tank. PCR for stx1 and stx2 was shown to provide a useful screen for toxin-producing E. coli O157:H7, and IMS subculture improved recovery. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) was used to compare patient and environmental E. coli O157:H7 isolates. Among patient isolates, 117 of 128 (91.5%) were type 1 or 1a (three or fewer bands different). Among the water distribution system isolates, 13 of 19 (68%) were type 1 or 1a. Additionally, PFGE of C. jejuni isolates revealed that 29 of 35 (83%) had indistinguishable PFGE patterns. The PFGE results implicated the water distribution system as the main source of the E. coli O157:H7 outbreak. This investigation demonstrates the potential for outbreaks involving more than one pathogen and the importance of analyzing isolates from multiple patients and environmental samples to develop a better understanding of bacterial transmission during an outbreak.},

	annote = {Confined aquifers are overlain by low-permeability aquitards that are commonly assumed to protect underlying aquifers from microbial contaminants. However, empirical data on microbial contamination beneath aquitards is limited. This study determined the occurrence of human pathogenic viruses in well water from a deep sandstone aquifer confined by a regionally extensive shale aquitard. Three public water-supply wells were each sampled 10 times over 15 months. Samples were analyzed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for several virus groups and by cell culture for infectious enteroviruses. Seven of 30 samples were positive by RTPCR for enteroviruses; one of these was positive for infectious echovirus 18. The virus-positive samples were collected from two wells cased through the aquitard, indicating the viruses were present in the confined aquifer. Samples from the same wells showed atmospheric tritium, indicating water recharged within the past few decades. Hydrogeologic conditions support rapid porous media transport of viruses through the upper sandstone aquifer to the top of the aquitard 61 m below ground surface. Natural fractures in the shale aquitard are one possible virus transport pathway through the aquitard; however, windows, cross-connecting well bores, or imperfect grout seals along well casings also may be involved. Deep confined aquifers can be more vulnerable to contamination by human viruses than commonly believed.},

	annote = {In the summer 2001, the microbiological water quality of two contiguous urban coastal beaches (Porto, Portugal) was surveyed for 18 consecutive days. The sampling strategy consisted in sampling surface water in early morning, noon and afternoon. A total of 184 samples were processed at Pastoras beach, a confined area between two jetties, and Ourigo Beach more open to the ocean. At the first beach site, all samples exceeded fecal contamination above guide values (GV) and 82.6{\%} above mandatory values (MV) set out in the EU Bathing Water Directive; whereas at Pastoras Beach, the figures were 93.5{\%} for GV and 26.1{\%} for MV, showing a potential health risk. The periodicity of fecal indicators in raw sewage, the tidal status and wind conditions dramatically influenced the water quality. The quality decreased in the morning regardless of tide conditions, but improved subsequently during the day, particularly during high tide and under the influence of afternoon NW winds. These dynamics are incompatible with the fortnight routine sampling according to the recommendations of the EU Bathing Water Directive, and the strategy should be revised on a beach-to-beach basis, having in mind the profile for the coastal zone. {\copyright}2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

	annote = {Mill Creek in Cleveland, Ohio, receives discharges from combined-sewer overflows (CSOs) and other sanitary-sewage inputs. These discharges affect the water quality of the creek and that of its receiving stream, the Cuyahoga River. In an effort to mitigate this problem, the Northeast Ohio Regional Sewer District implemented a project to eliminate or control (by reducing the number of overflows) all of the CSOs in the Mill Creek watershed. This study focused on monitoring the microbiological water quality of the creek before and during sewage-collection system modifications. Routine samples were collected semimonthly from August 2001 through September 2004 at a site near a U.S. Geological Survey stream gage near the mouth of Mill Creek. In addition, event samples were collected September 19 and 22, 2003, when rainfall accumulations were 0.5 inches (in.) or greater. Concentrations of Escherichia coli (E. coli) were determined and instantaneous discharges were calculated. Streamflow and water-quality characteristics were measured at the time of sampling, and precipitation data measured at a nearby precipitation gage were obtained from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Concentrations of E. coli were greater than Ohio's single-sample maximum for primary-contact recreation (298 colony-forming units per 100 milliliters (CFU/100 mL)) in 84 percent of the routine samples collected. In all but one routine sample E. coli concentrations in samples collected when instantaneous streamflows were greater than 20 cubic feet per second (ft3/s) were greater than Ohio's single-sample maximum. When precipitation occurred in the 24-hour period before routine sample collection, concentrations were greater than the maximum in 89 percent of the samples as compared to 73 percent when rainfall was absent during the 24 hours prior to routine sample collection. Before modifications to the sewage-collection system in the watershed began, E. coli concentrations in Mill Creek ranged from 220 to 29,000 CFU/100 mL. After major modifications, E. coli concentrations ranged from 110 to 80,000 CFU/100 mL. The percentage of sample E. coli concentrations in the former group greater than Ohio's single-sample maximum was 88 percent, whereas 85 percent of sample concentrations was greater than the maximum after major modifications occurred. Instantaneous discharges of E. coli were calculated for each of the modification periods. No statistically significant difference was observed between the median instantaneous discharges of E. coli for the premodification and minor-modification periods (5.1 × 106 and 3.6 × 106 CFU per second, respectively). During rainfall events in September 2003, samples were collected every 15 to 30 minutes. E. coli concentrations in all of these samples (n = 34) were greater than Ohio's single-sample maximum for primary-contact recreation. On September 19, total accumulated rainfall was 1.7 in., and streamflow reached a peak of 1,040 ft3/s. Sample collection started after 0.8 in. of precipitation had fallen and continued throughout the remainder of the storm. For these samples, E. coli concentrations ranged from 32,000 to 140,000 CFU/100 mL. On September 22, total accumulated rainfall was 0.5 in., and streamflow reached a peak of 497 ft3/s. Sample collection began before the start of the rain and continued throughout the storm. E. coli concentrations ranged from 450 to 260,000 CFU/100 mL. },

A rapid (1-hour) method for detecting Escherichia coli (E. coli) in water was tested and compared to the standard (24-hour) method for determining E. coli concentrations. Environmental data were collected to determine turbidity, rainfall, and streamflow at the time of sampling. In the previous study (2004-5), data collected were used to develop predictive models to determine recreational water quality in the river at two sites within the park. Data collected during this continued study (2006) were used to test these models. At Jaite, a centrally located site within the park, the model correctly predicted exceedances or nonexceedances of the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency maximum for recreational water quality in 80 percent of samples. At Old Portage, a site near the upstream boundary of the park, the model correctly predicted recreational water quality in 58 percent of samples. All of the data collected in 2004-6 will be used to develop more accurate models for use in future studies. Analysis and discussion of model results are scheduled to be included in an upcoming USGS Scientific Investigations Report.},

	annote = {Enteropathogen contamination of groundwater, including potable water sources, is a global concern. The spreading on land of animal slurries and manures, which can contain a broad range of pathogenic microorganisms, is considered a major contributor to this contamination. Some of the pathogenic microorganisms applied to soil have been observed to leach through the soil into groundwater, which poses a risk to public health. There is a critical need, therefore, for characterization of pathogen movement through the vadose zone for assessment of the risk to groundwater quality due to agricultural activities. A lysimeter experiment was performed to investigate the effect of soil type and condition on the fate and transport of potential bacterial pathogens, using Escherichia coli as a marker, in four Irish soils (n = 9). Cattle slurry (34 tonnes per ha) was spread on intact soil monoliths (depth, 1 m; diameter, 0.6 m) in the spring and summer. No effect of treatment or the initial soil moisture on the E. coli that leached from the soil was observed. Leaching of E. coli was observed predominantly from one soil type (average, 1.11 $\pm$0.77 CFU ml--1), a poorly drained Luvic Stagnosol, under natural rainfall conditions, and preferential flow was an important transport mechanism. E. coli was found to have persisted in control soils for more than 9 years, indicating that autochthonous E. coli populations are capable of becoming naturalized in the low-temperature environments of temperate maritime soils and that they can move through soil. This may compromise the use of E. coli as an indicator of fecal pollution of waters in these regions.},

Known numbers of target cells were added to distilled and tap water samples, filtered, and disrupted directly on the membranes for recovery of DNA for QPCR analysis. The assay's sensitivities were between one and three cells per filter. The accuracy of the cell estimates was between 50 and 200{\%} of their true value (95{\%} confidence level). In similar tests with surface water samples, the presence of PCR inhibitory compounds necessitated further purification and/or dilution of the DNA extracts, with resultant reductions in sensitivity but generally not in quantitative accuracy. Analyses of a series of freshwater samples collected from a recreational beach showed positive correlations between the QPCR results and colony counts of the corresponding target species. Positive correlations were also seen between the cell quantities of the target Candida species detected in these analyses and colony counts of Enterococcus organisms. With a combined sample processing and analysis time of less than 4 h, this method shows great promise as a tool for rapidly assessing potential exposures to waterborne pathogenic Candida species from drinking and recreational waters and may have applications in the detection of fecal pollution.},

Sampling sites collected runoff from areas of urban and agricultural land use patterns. F-specific coliphages were concentrated from 2-L freshwater samples by polyethylene glycol precipitation, isolated using the double agar layer (DAL) method, confirmed as F+RNA by RNAse suppression, and serotyped. A subset of serotyped F+RNA were confirmed by genotyping. To determine relative survival, 10 confirmed F+RNA field isolates and 5 prototypic F+RNA were spiked into surface water and incubated at 251C for 36 days. F-specific coliphage isolation was strongly associated with rainfall events and was infrequent from primarily animal impacted surface waters. Field isolates were predominantly Type I F+RNA (81%) and raw sewage isolates were predominantly Type III F+RNA (57%). Genotyping from either the watershed or raw sewage samples never positively identified Type IV F+RNA. Results from laboratory studies showed that F+RNA differ in their survival in water and that Type IV strains were the least persistent. Type III F+RNA were found to be reliably related to the release of uncontrolled human fecal material in the watershed, but the results of this study suggest that further study is required before utilizing for fecal source identification in natural waters.},

	annote = {The wave propagation and flow modules of the TELEMAC system have been applied to the Adour River mouth and the adjacent beaches of Anglet (France). The wave propagation has been simulated using the phase-averaged model TOMAWAC. In addition, the phase-resolving REFDIF S model has been also used, as the diffraction of wind waves, which is not taken into account in TOMAWAC, can occur in the vicinity of the River mouth. Next, the hydrodynamics has been simulated using the two-dimensional depth-averaged flow TELEMAC 2D model. The numerical results are compared with field measurements collected in March 2003. Model performance statistics are calculated in order to assess the accuracy of the predictions at six locations. Regarding the computation of the wave propagation, a root mean square error (RMSE) is evaluated for the significant wave height, the mean period and the peak direction of propagation. For the flow computation, a mean absolute error (MAE) is used as it is applicable to vector quantities. A classification is also adopted that categorises the quality of the results. Regarding the significant wave height, the average relative RMSE is of 18.2{\%} for the TOMAWAC computations whereas the error is of 30.8{\%} for the REFDIF S simulations. Concerning the peak wave direction, the RMSE is about 10$\,^{\circ}$. Both models predict the wave direction normal to the shore whereas the experimental parameters are more variable. However, the areas, where energy concentrates, are well reproduced. The classification of errors shows that TELEMAC 2D flow predictions are in a range from excellent to reasonable. {\copyright}2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

During the last thirty years sewage discharges have been monitored monthly for levels of faecal coliform bacteria at approximately thirty-four shore sites and twenty offshore sites. These coliform counts are used as bacteriological indicators of sewage pollution, in order to assess the risk to humans of infections that might result from the consumption of contaminated shellfish or from bathing in sewage-polluted waters. Most of the areas sampled from the inner firth were shown to be grossly polluted, particularly in late summer, and regularly to exceed guideline levels throughout the year. Since the commissioning of the new Seafield sewage works in 1979, a general improvement in bacterial and viral counts has been recorded on the south shore of the inner firth. In the last decade two European Community directives relating to the quality of seawater for bathing and shellfish growing have been promulgated, which set guideline and mandatory levels for the number of faecal coli in seawater. The Scottish Development Department has recently designated five beaches as bathing beaches and two areas on the north and south shores of the firth as shellfish growing areas. These areas have been regularly monitored by Forth River Purification Board and the published results of both surveys are analysed. The virological studies carried out by the Forth Pollution Group of Napier College before and after the major change in the sewage discharge pattern into the Firth of Forth are reviewed.},

Bacteriological surveys were conducted at both bays to assess water quality and to determine potential sources of pollution. These surveys were conducted during the wet season of 1996 and the dry season of 1997. Eleven sample stations were established at Welcome Bay and 12 at Chaguaramas Bay. Freshwater samples were collected from rivers and drains within the survey area. Marine water samples were collected from marinas, bathing beaches and inshore and outer areas at both bays. Five water samples were collected from each sampling station during the wet season of 1996 and six during the dry season of 1997. The membrane filter technique was used to determine faecal coliform and Escherichia coli levels in all samples. There was a seasonal effect on water quality, with significantly higher faecal coliform levels in the wet season, when water quality was not in compliance with international standards. This represents a potential health risk in bathing areas. Water quality was better at the outer area of both bays. Water quality at the inner bay areas was most likely adversely affected by land-based sources of pollution identified in this study. These sources include three drains and two rivers, which discharged into the bays. Yachts were apparently not a source of sewage pollution: there was no significant relationship between yacht number and faecal coliform levels.},

A geographic information system (GIS) was used to select residential water wells for sampling. Well water samples were analyzed for pH, conductivity, organic compounds, and nutrient and anion concentrations. All samples were further tested for presence of fungi (maintained for up to 28 days and colonies counted and identified microscopically), and metal and trace element concentration by inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometry and atomic emission spectrometry. Surface water samples were tested for dissolved oxygen and evidence of leptospiral bacterial presence. A polymerase chain reaction protocol was optimized for detection of pathogenic leptospires, and the sensitivity of the assay was determined. The Spearman correlation method was used to assess the association between the endpoints for these field/laboratory analyses and the incidence of cancer of the renal pelvis obtained from the Louisiana Tumor Registry. Significant associations were revealed between the cancer rate and the overall number of organic compounds, the fungi Zygomycetes, the nutrients PO4 and NH3, and thirteen chemical elements (As, B, Br, Cl, Cr, F, Li, Na, P, Rb, Se, Sr, W) from the well water as compared to the controls. Among the species of fungi from the total of 136 isolates were 12 Penicillium spp., at least two Aspergillus spp., a number of other genera (Alternaria sp., Eupenicillium lapidosum, Cladosporium sp., Epicoccum sp., Trichoderma sp., Paecilomyces sp., Chrysosporium sp., Chloridium sp.), and Zygomycetes, and Coelmycetes -- some of which are known mycotoxin producers. The two control wells yielded a mean of 6.5 (SD = 3.5355) individual isolates, while the mean number of isolates from all other sites was 7.6 (SD = 4.4866). Presence of human pathogenic leptospires was detected in 4/8 (50 percent) of the surface water sites sampled.

	annote = { The aim of this study was to examine a rapid method for detecting Escherichia coli and enterococci in recreational water. Water samples were assayed for E. coli and enterococci by traditional and immunomagnetic separation/adenosine triphosphate (IMS/ATP) methods. Three sample treatments were evaluated for the IMS/ATP method: double filtration, single filtration, and direct analysis. Pearson's correlation analysis showed strong, significant, linear relations between IMS/ATP and traditional methods for all sample treatments; strongest linear correlations were with the direct analysis (r = 0.62 and 0.77 for E. coli and enterococci, respectively). Additionally, simple linear regression was used to estimate bacteria concentrations as a function of IMS/ATP results. The correct classification of water-quality criteria was 67% for E. coli and 80% for enterococci. The IMS/ATP method is a viable alternative to traditional methods for faecal-indicator bacteria. The IMS/ATP method addresses critical public health needs for the rapid detection of faecal-indicator contamination and has potential for satisfying US legislative mandates requiring methods to detect bathing water contamination in 2 h or less. Moreover, IMS/ATP equipment is considerably less costly and more portable than that for molecular methods, making the method suitable for field applications.},

This river that burned gave international attention to water-quality issues and encouraged action through the passage of environmental legislation, especially the Clean Water Act. U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) scientists, in partnership with the National Park Service (NPS), have been working together to collect scientific information to help promote clean water and the preservation of aquatic ecosystems. Fiscal year 2005 concluded the field season for testing a new, rapid method for estimating Escherichia coli (E. coli) levels in the Cuyahoga River. The immunomagnetic (IMS) separation/adenosine triphosphate (ATP) rapid method, developed by researchers at the University of Michigan, uses magnetic beads that are coated with antibodies that are specific for E. coli. The bacteria attach to the antibodies that are bound to the magnetic beads and then are separated from the rest of the water sample with a magnet. Bacteria levels are measured indirectly by way of the concentration of an organic molecule, ATP, contained within the bacterial cell. Results of the rapid method are demonstrating a strong correlation with the standard 24-hour plating method currently used for determining bacteria levels. Results of the IMS/ATP rapid method could be provided within an hour of collecting the sample, giving parks with freshwater-based recreation the ability to alert visitors about bacteria levels. If successful, the rapid bacteria method used by the USGS would allow park managers to make decisions based on current information---not yesterday's information---and disseminate the results to the public.},

	annote = {The microbiological water quality of a 23-mile segment of the Cuyahoga River within the Cuyahoga Valley National Park was examined in this study. This segment of the river receives discharges of contaminated water from stormwater, combined-sewer overflows, and incompletely disinfected wastewater. Frequent exceedances of Ohio microbiological water-quality standards result in a health risk to the public who use the river for water-contact recreation. Water samples were collected during the recreational season of May through October at four sites on the Cuyahoga River in 2000, at three sites on the river in 2002, and from the effluent of the Akron Water Pollution Control Station (WPCS) both years. The samples were collected over a similar range in streamflow in 2000 and 2002. Samples were analyzed for physical and chemical constituents, as well as the following microbiological indicators and pathogenic organisms: Escherichia coli (E. coli), Salmonella, F-specific and somatic coliphage, enterovirus, infectious enterovirus, hepatitis A virus, Clostridium perfringens (C. perfringens), Cryptosporidium, and Giardia. The relations of the microorganisms to each other and to selected water-quality measures were examined. All microorganisms analyzed for, except Cryptosporidium, were detected at least once at each sampling site. Concentrations of E. coli exceeded the Ohio primary-contact recreational standard (298 colonies per 100 milliliters) in approximately 87 percent of the river samples and generally were higher in the river samples than in the effluent samples. C. perfringens concentrations were positively and significantly correlated with E. coli concentrations in the river samples and generally were higher in the effluent samples than in the river samples. Several of the river samples that met the Ohio E. coli secondary-contact recreational standard (576 colonies per 100 milliliters) had detections of enterovirus, infectious enterovirus, hepatitis A virus, and Salmonella, indicating that there are still risks even when the E. coli standard is not exceeded. River samples in which the secondary-contact recreational standard for E. coli was exceeded showed a higher percentage of the co-occurrence of pathogenic organisms than samples that met the standard. This indicates that in this study area, E. coli is a useful indicator of human health risk. Detections of hepatitis A virus tended to be associated with higher median concentrations of somatic coliphage, F-specific coliphage, and infectious enterovirus. In addition, geometric mean C. perfringens concentrations tended to be higher in samples where hepatitis A virus was present than in samples where hepatitis A virus was absent. Hepatitis A virus was not detected in samples collected upstream from the Akron WPCS; all downstream detections had coincident detections in the Akron WPCS effluent, suggesting that Akron WPCS was a principal source of hepatitis A virus at the downstream sites. Geometric mean concentrations of E. coli were calculated on the basis of analytical results from at least five samples collected at each river site during May, July, and September of 2000. In each case, the Ohio geometric-mean primary-contact recreational standard of 126 col/100 mL was exceeded. E. coli concentrations were significantly correlated with streamflow and increased with streamflow at sites upstream and downstream from the Akron WPCS. This indicates that E. coli loads from sources upstream from the Akron WPCS have the potential to appreciably influence the frequency of attainment of recreational water-quality standards at downstream locations.},

Results from this method are available within 1 h from the start of sample processing. Significant linear correlations were found between the IMS/ATP results and results from traditional culture-based methods for E. coli and enterococci enumeration for one location in California, two locations in North Carolina, and one location in Ohio (r values ranged from 0.87 to 0.97).

This study sought to understand the sources of E. coli in Dunes Creek's central branch. A systematic survey of random and fixed sampling points of water and sediment was conducted over 3 years. E. coli concentrations in Dunes Creek and beach water were significantly correlated. Weekly monitoring at 14 stations during 1999 and 2000 indicated chronic loading of E. coli throughout the stream. Significant correlations between E. coli numbers in stream water and stream sediment, submerged sediment and margin, and margin and 1 m from shore were found. Median E. coli counts were highest in stream sediments, followed by bank sediments, sediments along spring margins, stream water, and isolated pools; in forest soils, E. coli counts were more variable and relatively lower. Sediment moisture was significantly correlated with E. coli counts. Direct fecal input inadequately explains the widespread and consistent occurrence of E. coli in the Dunes Creek watershed; long-term survival or multiplication or both seem likely. The authors conclude that (i) E. coli is ubiquitous and persistent throughout the Dunes Creek basin, (ii) E. coli occurrence and distribution in riparian sediments help account for the continuous loading of the bacteria in Dunes Creek, and (iii) ditching of the stream, increased drainage, and subsequent loss of wetlands may account for the chronically high E. coli levels observed.},

	annote = { The macrophytic green alga, Cladophora, harbors high densities of fecal indicator bacteria, E. coli and enterococci, in shoreline waters of Lake Michigan. The main objective of this study was to determine the population structure and genetic relatedness of Cladophora-borne E. coli and to determine the potential enteric bacterial pathogens associated with Cladophora. A total of 879 E. coli isolates were collected from Cladophora tufts (mats) growing on rocks from a breakwater located within the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore in northwest Indiana. The horizontal, fluorophore-enhanced rep-PCR (HFERP) DNA fingerprinting technique was used to determine the genetic relatedness of the isolates to each other and to those in a library of E. coli DNA fingerprints. While the E. coli isolates from Cladophora showed a high degree of genetic relatedness (≥92% similarity) in most cases, the isolates were genetically distinct. Both spatial and temporal influences contributed to the genetic diversity. Isolates collected from 2002 were distinctly different from those obtained in 2003. Cladophora-borne E. coli isolates represented a unique group, distinct from other E. coli isolates in the DNA fingerprint library tested. In Cladophora mats, bacterial pathogens, such as shiga toxin-producing E. coli and Shigella, were rather sporadic compared to Salmonella and Campylobacter. Further, genotypically-identical Salmonella isolates were associated with geographically and temporally-distinct Cladophora algae. In contrast, Campylobacter isolates were genetically diverse. These results suggest that E. coli strains associated with Cladophora may be a recurring source of indicator bacteria to the nearshore beach and Cladophora is a likely secondary habitat for pathogenic bacteria in Lake Michigan. The association of these bacteria with Cladophora warrants additional studies to assess potential health impacts to beach users.}

	annote = {The enterococcal surface protein (esp) gene found in Enterococcus faecalis and E. faecium has recently been explored as a marker of sewage pollution in recreational waters but its occurrence and distribution in environmental enterococci has not been well-documented. If the esp gene is found in environmental samples, there are potential implications for microbial source tracking applications. In the current study, a total of 452 samples (lake water, 100; stream water, 129; nearshore sand, 96; and backshore sand, 71; Cladophora sp.(Chlorophyta),41;andperiphyton(mostlyBacillariophyceae), 15) collected from the coastal watersheds of southern Lake Michigan were selectively cultured for enterococci and then analyzed for the esp gene by PCR, targeting E. faecalis/ E. faecium (espfs/fm) and E. faecium (espfm). Overall relative frequencies for espfs/fm and espfm were 27.4 and 5.1%. Respective percent frequency for the espfs/fm and espfm was 36 and 14% in lake water; 38.8 and 2.3% in stream water; 24 and 6.3% in nearshore sand; 0% in backshore sand; 24.4 and 0% in Cladophora sp.; and 33.3 and 0% in periphyton. The overall occurrence of both espfs/fm and espfm was significantly related (x2=49, P < 0.0001). Post-rain incidence of espfs/fm increased in lake and stream water and nearshore sand. Further, E. coli and enterococci cell densities were significant predictors for espfs/fm occurrence in post-rain lake water, but espfm was not. F+ coliphage densities were not significant predictors for espfm or espfs/fm gene incidence. In summary, the differential occurrence of the esp gene in the environment suggests that it is not limited to human fecal sources and thus may weaken its use as a reliable tool in discriminating contaminant sources (i.e., human vs nonhuman).},

	annote = { The bacterial pathogens Shigella, Salmonella, Campylobacter, and shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) were recently found to be associated with Cladophora growing in southern Lake Michigan. Preliminary results indicated that the Salmonella strains associated with Cladophora were genetically identical to each other. However, because of the small sample size (n ¼ 37 isolates) and a lack of information on spatial--temporal relationships, the nature of the association between Cladophora and Salmonella remained speculative. In this study, we investigated the population structure and genetic relatedness of a large number of Cladophora- borne Salmonella isolates from Lake Michigan (n ¼ 133), as well as those isolated from stream and lake water (n ¼ 31), aquatic plants (n ¼ 8), and beach sands and sediments (n ¼ 8) from adjacent watersheds. Salmonella isolates were collected during 2005--2007 between May and August from Lake Michigan beachsheds in Wisconsin, Illinois, and Indiana. The genetic relatedness of Salmonella isolates was examined by using the horizontal, fluorophore-enhanced rep-PCR (HFERP) DNA fingerprinting technique. While the Salmonella isolates associated with Cladophora exhibited a high degree of genetic relatedness (92% similarity), the isolates were not all genetically identical. Spatial and temporal relationships were evident in the populations examined, with tight clustering of the isolates both by year and location. These findings suggest that the relationship between Salmonella and Cladophora is likely casual and is related to input sources (e.g. wastewater, runoff, birds) and the predominant Salmonella genotype surviving in the environment during a given season. Our studies indicate that Cladophora is likely an important reservoir for Salmonella and other enteric bacterial pathogens in Lake Michigan beachsheds, which in turn may influence nearshore water quality.},

High concentrations of Escherichia coli and enterococci have been reported in Cladophora along the Lake Michigan shore. The objective of this study was to determine if Cladophora supported growth of these indicator bacteria. Algal leachate readily supported in vitro multiplication of E. coli and enterococci, suggesting that leachates contain necessary growth-promoting substances. Growth was directly related to the concentration of algal leachate. E. coli survived for over 6 months in dried Cladophora stored at 4 degC; residual E. coli grew after mat rehydration, reaching a carrying capacity of 8 log CFU g-1 in 48 h. Results of this study also show that the E. coli strains associated with Cladophora are highly related; in most instances they are genetically different from each other, suggesting that the relationship between E. coli and Cladophora may be casual. These findings indicate that Cladophora provides a suitable environment for indicator bacteria to persist for extended periods and to grow under natural conditions.},

Unchecked rural and urban development also has contributed to changes in water quality, including enhanced microbial populations and increased waterborne pathogen occurrence. In this study we look at changing environment within the Oldman River Basin and its impact on water quality and quantity. The cumulative effects include a decline in net water supplies, and declining quality resulting in increased risk of disease. Our data indicates that decreases in the rate of flow of water can result in sedimentation of bacterial contaminants within the water column. Water for ecosystems, urban consumption, recreation and distribution through irrigation is often drawn from waterholding facilities such as dams and weirs, and concern must be expressed over the potential for contaminate build-up and disproportionate potential of these structures to pose a risk to human and animal health. With disruption of natural flow rates for water resulting from environmental change such as global warming and/or human intervention, increased attention needs to be paid to use of best management practices to protect source water supplies.},

The enterococcus level in the bathing water is the best single measure of its quality relative to the risk of swimming-associated, pollution-related infectious disease. Three mathematically expressible indicator-illness relationships (criteria) are available from which recreational water quality guidelines can be extrapolated from the criteria once a decision has been made as to the acceptable risk of illness. The recently revised USEPA recreational water quality criteria and guidelines reflect this regulatory approach. A model is presented for the regulation of water quality which defines decision-making and actions by federal nd local agencies as well as resource users. This model requires the ability to predict illness rates from monitoring data. Three equations, each corresponding to one of the criteria, are available for doing so. Concept and supporting epidemiological data indicate that the criteria do not apply to situations in which the sources of contamination are the fecal wastes from small numbers of individuals (e.g. boat wastes, the bathers themselves) or from lower animals (e.g. stormwater run-off). Differential die-off of viral pathogens and the bacterial indicator during wastewater chlorination and protracted residence in marine waters may also confound the use of the criteria in specific situations.

Symptomatology rates among swimmers (defined as immersion of the head in the water) relative to non-swimming but beach-going controls at a 'barely acceptable' (BA) beach and a 'relatively unpolluted' (RU) beach were examined. Measurements were made for a number of potential water quality indicators. The symptom rates, categorized as gastrointestinal (GI), respiratory, 'other', and 'disabling' (stayed home, stayed in bed, consulted a physician), were higher among swimmers than nonswimmers. As in the pretest conducted the previous year, the rate of GI symptoms was significantly higher among swimmers relative to nonswimmers at the RA but not the RU beach. Children, Hispanic Americans, and the low-middle socioeconomic groups were identified as the most susceptible portions of the population.},

	annote = {The derivation of guidelines and standards based on acceptable risk for recreational water quality is explained. The two microbial guidelines or standards most commonly used in the U.S. are the total coliform limit of 1000/100 mL of water and the fecal coliform limit of 200/100 mL. The microbial guideline states that fecal coliforms should be used as the indicator organism for evaluating the microbiological suitability of recreational waters. Coliforms were rejected as the indicator of choice for evaluating sanitary conditions because of their variable correlation with fecal contamination. Ideally, recreational water quality indicators are microorganisms or chemicals whose densities or concentrations in the water can be quantitatively related to swimming-associated health hazards. One problem with the existing microbial guidelines for direct contact recreational waters is that they are not amenable to, or developed in the context of, risk analysis. They were derived from a barely detectable health effect rather than from exposure-response data. Therefore they do not allow for deliberate decisions by local, state, or federal officials about incremental decreases in the health risks involved. Rather, decision making is limited to acceptance or rejection of the specific limits. In a three year study of New York City beaches performed to determine which were the best indicators, the superiority of enterococci versus fecal coliforms was seen from the regression lines displayed on graphs of linear relationships between swimming-associated rates for gastrointestinal symptoms and mean enterococcus and fecal coliform densities in the water. Not only is this criterion more reliable because of the greater credibility of the information obtained, but also the consequences of the illness are more amenable to economic analysis. (Baker-IVI)},

	annote = {Although, previously, ear and eye infections caused by P. aeruginosa constitute a major hazard of swimming, there is no conclusive evidence demonstrating a cause and effect relationship of P. aeruginosa densities in the water to the incidence of these infections in swimming populations. Because about 15 percent of the human population have the organism in the ear as part of the ''normal'' flora, it is entirely possible that it is these individuals who actually are at risk, that the source of the organisms is endogenous, and that ''trauma'' to the ear canals associated with swimming (especially underwater swimming) and diving allows these organisms to invade the tissues. In fact, individuals who normally carry this organism may not be ''normal'' at all in the sense that they may already have lost one or more of the barriers that prevent the growth of P. aeruginosa in the ear canal. These individuals will have to be identified in the epidemiological studies required to determine the need for criteria and standards governing P. aeruginosa densities in recreational waters. The data presented herein suggest two situations for this type of epidemiological study. The observation that, at the Lake Michigan beaches, fecal pollution was carried in by north winds and that P. aeruginosa densities peaked 1 to 2 days following a north wind would suggest these or other beaches subject to fluctuating pollution for such a study. Secondly, high P. aeruginosa densities could be expected wherever recreational waters are subject to the discharge of nutrients.},

The principal pollution focus is the city of Mar del Plata which, like many other big cities, overturns its industrial, rainy and urban sewer liquids to the sea, with no previous treatment, in most of the cases. The effluent open sewer, situated in the north suburban district, drives into the sea the content of three maximum sewers that recollect domiciliary branches. To determine quali and quantitatively heterotrophic aerobic mesophilic, psicrophilic, marine and E. coli bacteria, water samples were taken at 0.30 m depth, behind the shoal, in each of the 17 determined stations (Figure 1), and an enumeration of colonies in agar plate was carried out in duplicate. E. coli was used as indicator of fecal contamination and served to establish the quality of the water used in bath and other recreational functions. The quantification was done by recounts in plates or membrane filter methods, in duplicate, with previous revivification. Serology of strains isolated from marine medium by polyvalent sera was done. Independently of the recount obtained, the distribution of serological groups was rather uniform along all the coast. Colony-forming units (CFU) did not exceed values of 240/100 ml, except in the beach situated at 0.5 km of the effluent, which always gave values above those accepted internationally for bathing waters or other recreational uses (Figure 2).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

Testing with previously characterized strains showed that the assay could achieve 100{\%} diagnostic sensitivity and >95{\%} diagnostic specificity. Results from water samples were congruent for conventional PCR. Serial dilutions of template DNA demonstrated that the bench top analytic sensitivity of the entire assay was equivalent to <1600 cells.

Methods and Results: Soil and water samples were spiked with E. coli O157:H7 and subjected to two stages of enrichment prior to multiplex PCR. Detection sensitivities were as high as 1 cfu ml$\pm$1 drinking water and 2 cfu g$\pm$1 soil. Starvation of E. coli O157:H7 for 35 d prior to addition to soil did not affect the ability of the assay to detect initial cell numbers as low as 10 cfu g$\pm$1 soil. Use of an 8-h primary enrichment enabled detection of as few as 6 cfu g$\pm$1 soil, and 104 cfu g$\pm$1 soil with a 6-h primary enrichment. When soil was inoculated with 105 cfu g$\pm$1, the PCR assay indicated persistence of E. coli O157:H7 during a 35 d incubation. However, when soil was inoculated with lower numbers of pathogen, PCR ampli{\textregistered}cation signals indicated survival to be dependent on cell concentration. Conclusions: A multiplex PCR-based assay, in combination with an enrichment strategy enabled sensitive and rapid detection of E. coli O157:H7 in soil and water. Significance and Impact of the Study: The ability to sensitively detect E.coli O157:H7 in environmental material within one working day represents a considerable advancement over alternative more time-consuming methods for detection of this pathogen.},

METHODS: A total of 98 strains of E. coli, 50 from storm sewers and 48 from the seawater were analyzed resistance to several antimicrobials by disk diffusion and agar dilution and to heavy metals by dilution in plates with aqueous solutions of CuSO4 incorporated to Mueller Hinton agar in concentrations of 100, 150, 200 and 250 ig/mL and HgCl2 in concentrations of 5, 10, 20, 30, and 50 ig/mL. Standard strains were used as control. RESULTS: Among the twelve antimicrobials tested, 28 (28.5{\%}) of E. coli strains showed resistance to different antimicrobials drugs to seven. The greatest resistance rate was to tetracycline (46.4{\%}), ampicillin (39.3{\%}) and cephalothin (32.1{\%}), with the remainder (nitrophurantoine, nalidixic acid, sulfatomexazol-trimethoprin and chloramphenicol) at lower percentages. Among the heavy metals, all the strains (100{\%}) were resistant to zinc and to copper in the largest concentration (250 ig/mL), and 18.4{\%} were resistant to HgCl the 50 ig/mL. Ten (55.5{\%}) of the E. coli strains resistant to Hg were associated to resistance to antibiotics. CONCLUSION: These results suggest the existence of extra chromosomal genes in E. coli strains isolated from storm sewer water and adjacent seawater, which encoders of the resistance to antibiotics and heavy metals.},

Almost 36{\%} of the E. coli strains isolated were resistant to more than one antibiotic. All strains were resistant to zinc and copper at the highest concentration tested (250 μg/ml), and several (23.4{\%}) were resistant to mercury at 50 μg/ml.

Effluents coming from these communes are currently treated and outfallen at sea in a unique point. First analysis consisted in making an inventory of coastal-related activities. Then, we analysed the problems in relation to water quality on this area, in the objective of drawing up a map emphasising sensitivity to urban sewage at sea. Afterwards, we undertook a series of measurements on site aiming at evaluating the influence of present wastewater flowed into the sea and get data for numerical modelling. Simultaneously, calculation of currents by mathematical model were conducted in different meteorological and oceanographic conditions, from the mouth of the very South part of the Loire river, to Pen-Be, close to the mouth of the North part of the Vilaine river These data were compared with measurements collected, in order to simulate outfalls using a mathematical model of water quality. Concentrations (bacterial and heavy metals) contained in the sea, were calculated in various wind and tide conditions, and in different position of outlets. Therefore, the impact of present wastewater effluents at sea were analysed and other geographic zones could have been tested. The results extracted from this study lead to different scenarios and produced an outstanding tool for municipal sewage system scheme decision making.},

To assess potential risks from this pathway, there is a need for surrogates for SARS coronavirus to provide representative data on viral survival in contaminated water. This study evaluated survival of two surrogate coronaviruses, transmissible gastroenteritis (TGEV) and mouse hepatitis (MHV). These viruses remained infectious in water and sewage for days to weeks. At 25 C, time required for 99% reduction in reagent-grade water was 22 days for TGEV and 17 days for MHV. In pasteurized settled sewage, times for 99% reduction were 9 days for TGEV and 7 days for MHV. At 4 C, there was <1 log10 infectivity decrease for both viruses after four weeks. Coronaviruses can remain infectious for long periods in water and pasteurized settled sewage, suggesting contaminated water is a potential vehicle for human exposure if aerosols are generated.},

	annote = {Most library-dependent bacterial source tracking studies using Escherichia coli (E. coli) have focused on strain diversity of isolates obtained from known human and animal faecal sources for library development. In contrast, this study evaluated the genotype variation of E. coli isolated from natural surface water using pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus sequence polymerase chain reaction (ERIC-PCR) to better understand these naturally occurring populations. A total of 650 water samples were collected over a nine month period from eleven sampling stations from Lake Waco and Belton Lake in Central Texas. Of the 650 water samples collected, 412 were positive for E. coli, yielding a total of 631 E. coli isolates (1--12 isolates collected per sample). PFGE and ERIC-PCR patterns were successfully generated for 555 isolates and were compared using the curve-based Pearson's product--moment correlation coefficient. The 555 E. coli isolates represented 461 PFGE genotypes, with 84{\%} (386/461) of the genotypes being represented by individual isolates. The remaining 75 genotypes were represented by 2--5 isolates each. Using ERIC-PCR, the 555 E. coli isolates represented 175 genotypes, with 63{\%} (109/175) of the genotypes being represented by individual isolates. In contrast to the PFGE results, two ERIC-PCR genotypes represented 37{\%} of the E. coli isolates, (83 and 124 isolates, respectively), and were found throughout the watersheds both spatially and temporally. Based on the PFGE genotype diversity of water isolates, there is little evidence that a small number of environmentally-adapted E. coli represent dominant populations in the studied waterbodies. However, with the lower discriminatory power technique ERIC-PCR, an opposing conclusion might have been drawn. These results emphasize the importance of considering the resolving power of the source tracking technique being used when assessing strain diversity and geographical stability.},

	annote = {The presence of Salmonella and its relationship with indicator organisms of fecal pollution, such as total coliforms, fecal coliforms and fecal streptococci, was studied at two marine zones in Portugal. Seventeen different Salmonella serotypes were isolated and identified, S. virchow was the most frequently isolated (21.6{\%}). In addition, a high percentage (35.1{\%}) was recorded for some Salmonella serotypes of clinical significance, namely S. enteritidis, S. infantis, S. typhimurium and S. virchow. In any of the samples from the two zones Salmonella was not detected in the absence of any of the indicator organisms. However, the incidence of Salmonella as a function of indicator concentration intervals established by the EEC standards was 0, 10 and 19.3{\%} at guide values of total coliforms, fecal coliforms and fecal streptococci, respectively in the Faro samples (south of Portugal). In contrast, Salmonella incidence rates of 37.5, 36.4 and 33.3{\%} were recorded at the corresponding guide values the Caminha samples (north of Portugal). No significant correlations (p>0.005) were obtained between Salmonella and the indicators at the sampling stations; however, total coliforms and fecal streptococci were the indicators most closely related to Salmonella in Caminha and Faro samples, respectively. Survival experiments in Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis and S. typhimurium, using diffusion chambers, were performed to verify whether the lack of correlation between indicators and Salmonella was due to different inactivation rates in seawater. The results indicate that survival percentages of the three microorganisms tested were similar after 48 h of exposure to seawater.},

There is also a firm proposal to discharge the sewage deep into the sea through long marine outfalls. The existing levels of indicator organisms, total coliforms and fecal coliforms can provide to a large extent the information regarding the current pollutional status of the coastal waters. For guiding the design of marine sewage outfalls, it becomes necessary to fix certain norms for the bacteriological quality of beach waters used for recreation and bathing. From thirteen points along the Western shoreline ranging from ″clean″and ″polluted″beaches, and along the midstream of Thana creek, samples of water were collected asceptically during low and high tides usually once a month over a period of two years. The bacteriological patterns were related to the sanitary features on the shore. Even the ″clean″beaches were found to exhibit high counts of coliforms during certain periods. The paper presents the salient features of detailed survey carried out over a period of two years in 1971-72 and spot survey in 1981.},

The results obtained with the ICC-RT-PCR--nested PCR method were compared to the results obtained with the total culturable virus assay--most-probable-number (TCVA-MPN) method, the method recommended by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for monitoring viruses in surface and finished waters. Twenty-nine ICR surface water samples were analyzed. Viruses were concentrated by using filter adsorption-beef extract elution and organic flocculation techniques, and then the preparations were evaluated for viruses by visualizing cytopathic effects in the Buffalo green monkey kidney (BGMK) cell line. In the ICC-RT-PCR--nested PCR technique we used Caco-2 cells to propagate astroviruses and enteroviruses (ICC step), and we used BGMK cells to propagate adenovirus types 40 and 41, as well as enteroviruses. Fifteen of the 29 samples (51.7%) were positive for astrovirus as determined by the ICC-RT-PCR--nested PCR method, and eight of these samples (27.5%) contained infectious astrovirus. Seventeen of the 29 samples (58.6%) were positive for enteroviruses when the BGMK cell line was used, and six (27.6%) of these samples were determined to be infectious. Fourteen of the 29 samples (48.3%) were positive for adenovirus types 40 and 41, and 11 (37.9%) of these samples were determined to be infectious. Twenty-seven of the 29 samples (93.1%) were positive for a virus, and 19 (68.9%) of the samples were positive for an infectious virus. Only 5 of the 29 samples (17.2%) were positive as determined by the TCVA-MPN method. The ICC-RT-PCR--nested PCR method provided increased sensitivity compared to the TCVA-MPN method.},

It renders a more intelligent and user-friendly system on the problem domain. In this paper, a knowledge-based expert system on numerical modelling system for coastal water processes is delineated. Expert system application, as a key branch of artificial intelligence technology, is integrated with traditional numerical modelling for simulating flow and water quality phenomenon in coastal waters. The knowledge bases are classified into five major types, namely, a variety of models, relations between various model parameters and real physical conditions, feasible options of model parameters, question base as a user-interface directing the user to depict the actual physical conditions, and the rules of inference deducing the feasible choice of model and its parameters. A hybrid expert system shell, Visual Rule Studio, is employed as an ActiveX Designer under Microsoft Visual Basic environment because it combines the advantages of both production rules and object-oriented programming technology. Both forward chaining and backward chaining are used collectively during the inference process, which is mainly driven by premises and conditions with the highest factors of confidence. The inference engine will drive the decision tree to explore the most probable option of numerical model and parameters matching the real problem specifications. It is shown that the application and integration of the knowledge-based expert system technology into numerical modelling for coastal processes can provide substantial assistance to novice users for selection of numerical model as well as parameters. {\copyright}2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

We investigated Great Sulphur Spring on the western shore of Lake Erie and evaluated the phylogenetic affiliations of 189 bacterial and 77 archaeal 16S rRNA gene sequences from three habitats: the spring origin (11-m depth), bacterial-algal mats on the spring pond surface, and whitish filamentous materials from the spring drain. Water from the spring origin water was cold, pH 6.3, and anoxic (H2, 5.4 nM; CH4, 2.70 µM) with concentrations of S2--(0.03 mM), SO42--(14.8 mM), Ca2+ (15.7 mM), and HCO3--(4.1 mM) similar to those in groundwater from the local aquifer. No archaeal and few bacterial sequences were >95{\%} similar to sequences of cultivated organisms. Bacterial sequences were largely affiliated with sulfur-metabolizing or chemolithotrophic taxa in Beta-, Gamma-, Delta-, and Epsilonproteobacteria. Epsilonproteobacteria sequences similar to those obtained from other sulfidic environments and a new clade of Cyanobacteria sequences were particularly abundant (16{\%} and 40{\%}, respectively) in the spring origin clone library. Crenarchaeota sequences associated with archaeal-bacterial consortia in whitish filaments at a German sulfidic spring were detected only in a similar habitat at Great Sulphur Spring. This study expands the geographic distribution of many uncultured Archaea and Bacteria sequences to the Laurentian Great Lakes, indicates possible roles for epsilonproteobacteria in local aquifer chemistry and karst formation, documents new oscillatorioid Cyanobacteria lineages, and shows that uncultured, cold-adapted Crenarchaeota sequences may comprise a significant part of the microbial community of some sulfidic environments.},

	annote = {Cryptosporidium parvum, which is resistant to chlorine concentrations typically used in water treatment, is recognized as a significant waterborne pathogen. Recent studies have demonstrated that chlorine dioxide is a more efficient disinfectant than free chlorine against Cryptosporidium oocysts. It is not known, however, if oocysts from different suppliers are equally sensitive to chlorine dioxide. This study used both a most-probable-number-cell culture infectivity assay and in vitro excystation to evaluate chlorine dioxide inactivation kinetics in laboratory water at pH 8 and 21 degree C. The two viability methods produced significantly different results (P < 0.05). Products of disinfectant concentration and contact time (Ct values) of 1,000 mg super(.) min/liter were needed to inactivate approximately 0.5 log sub(10) and 2.0 log sub(10) units (99{\%} inactivation) of C. parvum as measured by in vitro excystation and cell infectivity, respectively, suggesting that excystation is not an adequate viability assay. Purified oocysts originating from three different suppliers were evaluated and showed marked differences with respect to their resistance to inactivation when using chlorine dioxide. Ct values of 75, 550, and 1,000 mg super(.) min/liter were required to achieve approximately 2.0 log sub(10) units of inactivation with oocysts from different sources. Finally, the study compared the relationship between easily measured indicators, including Bacillus subtilis (aerobic) spores and Clostridium sporogenes (anaerobic) spores, and C. parvum oocysts. The bacterial spores were found to be more sensitive to chlorine dioxide than C. parvum oocysts and therefore could not be used as direct indicators of C. parvum inactivation for this disinfectant. In conclusion, it is suggested that future studies address issues such as oocyst purification protocols and the genetic diversity of C. parvum, since these factors might affect oocyst disinfection sensitivity.},

	annote = {Analyses of Irish bathing water quality data sets are reported to investigate whether the parametric calculations proposed in the draft Bathing Water Directive are valid. Faecal coliforms (assumed to be Escherichia coli) and faecal streptococci (assumed to be intestinal enterococci) have been analysed separately. It was noted that classifications based on the parametric 95th percentile calculations disagreed with those based on percentage compliance with the standards on 13.8{\%} of occasions. When these disagreements were studied, it was found that the datasets frequently contained many censored data points (Result<1). Also, the datasets were not log normally distributed on at least 85{\%} of occasions. Both these findings fatally undermine the validity of using a parametric method for calculating 95th percentiles to classify bathing water quality. By contrast the non-parametric Hazen method is a better estimate of true population 95th percentiles, but essentially gives very similar classifications to the percentage compliance approach, fully agreeing on over 95{\%} of occasions. The same is also true when considering 90th percentiles. A series of Monte Carlo studies were also conducted to determine the impact of small numbers. It was ascertained that small sample sizes are very undependable in determining bathing water classification and the parametric method in particular is particularly unreliable. In conclusion, the parametric method for calculating bathing water compliance is so severely and fatally flawed statistically that it should not form the basis of any legislation. The Hazen method gives a better estimate of true 90th or 95th percentiles, though as the resultant classifications agree with percentage compliance so closely it is doubtful that there is any statistical value in using a percentile approach over the long established and well understood percentage compliance approach. {\copyright}2005 Elsevier Ltd.

The effects of the deacetylation degree, concentration, and molecular weight of chitosan on antibacterial activities were assessed. Chitosan exhibited the highest antibacterial activity against the Pseudomonas aeruginosa on the solid agar. Similar tendency was found when the bacteria were cultivated in liquid broth. The higher deacetylation degree and higher concentration of chitosan cause the higher antibacterial activities. The effect of molecular weight of chitosan on the inhibition efficacy of bacteria is dependent on the species of bacteria. Escherichia coli is sensitive to chitosan during its death phase and logarithmic phase. The antibacterial mechanism of chitosan was illustrated by the surface charge and persistence length. Results indicated that chitosan is potential as a natural disinfectant.},

Both organisms are present in high densities in external sources of faecal pollution of bathing beaches, with the average staphylococci to E. coli ratios being 0.04-3. Staphylococci may serve as an indicator of bather density and the risk of cross-infection amongst bathers (rather than as another indicator of faecal contamination) when the average staphylococci to E. coli ratio for a bathing beach is considerably higher than 3. The variability of microbial indicator densities means the routine sampling of bathing beaches should be carried out on weekend days with maximum numbers of swimmers exposed to the water, and spread throughout the bathing season.},

For infectious diseases, exposure might not only depend on exogenous sources of microbes, but also on the infection status of other individuals in the population. For example, waterborne infections from agents such as Cryptosporidium parvum and Escherichia coli: O157:H7 might be transmitted from contaminated water to humans through drinking water; from interpersonal contact; or from infected individuals to the environment, and back to other susceptible individuals. These multiple pathways and the dependency of exposure on the prevalence of infection in a population suggest that epidemiological models are required to complement standard risk assessments in order to quantify the risk of infection. This paper presents new models of infection transmission systems that are being developed for the US Environmental Protection Agency as part of a project to quantify the risk of microbial infection.

	annote = {Runoff from agricultural lands and farm animal feedlots is one of the major sources of fecal coliforms in surface waters, and fecal coliform (FC) bacteria concentrations tend to vary with season because of seasonal variations in climatic factors. However, El Ni{\~n}o -Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events may affect the extent and patterns of seasonality in FC levels in coastal waters. Water quality monitoring data for shellfish management collected during El Ni{\~n}o (1990, 1992, 1997), and La Ni{\~n}a (1999, 2000) years were analyzed to evaluate the extent to which these events influenced Pearl River stage, and bacterial levels, water temperature, and salinity in the western part of Mississippi Sound. Models to predict FC levels in relation to various environmental factors were also developed. In 1990, 1992 and 1997, FC geometric mean counts peaked in late winter (January/February) reaching 120 MPN (February 1990), 165 MPN (January 1992), and 86 MPN (January 1997), and then decreased considerably during spring and summer (1.2 - 19 MPN). Thereafter, FC abundance increased slightly in fall and early winter (1.9 - 24 MPN). Fecal coliform abundance during the 2000 La Ni{\~n}a year was much lower (1.0 - 10.3 MPN) than in 1992 (1.2 - 165 MPN), and showed no seasonal pattern from January to August, perhaps due to the relative scarcity of rainfall in 2000. In 1995 (ENSO neutral year), peak geometric mean FC count (46 MPN) was lower than during El Ni{\~n}o years and occurred in early spring (March). The seasonal and between year variations in FC levels determined the number of days during which the conditionally approved shellfish growing area was opened for harvesting shellfish. For example, from January to April 1997, the area was not opened for shellfish harvesting, whereas in 2000, the number of days during which the area was opened ranged from 6 - 27 (January to April) to 24 - 26 (October to December). ENSO events thus influenced the extent and timing of the peak levels of fecal coliforms in Mississippi Sound. Models consisting of one or more of the variables: Pearl River stage, water temperature, and salinity were developed to predict FC concentrations in the Sound. The model parameter(s) explained 56 to 91{\%} of the variations in FC counts. Management of shellfish in Mississippi Sound can be improved by utilizing information on the forecasted three to seven years occurrence of ENSO events. In addition, since Pearl River stage was the most important variable predicting FC concentration in the Sound, a study of the levels and sources of FC bacteria in the river, especially the middle and lower sections, is needed for developing a management plan for reducing FC bacteria pollution in the Sound. {\copyright}2005 MDPI.

	annote = {Two combined sewer outfall systems, the Selby Street and Laguna Street systems, in San Francisco, were studied. Eight storm overflows were monitored at the Selby Street outfall and two in the Laguna Street system. Monitoring included measurement of rainfall, discharge, and quality characteristics of the overflows. The bacteriological impact of overflows on receiving water was determined by a coliform survey of a segment of the municipal marina adjacent to the Laguna Street outfall. Laboratory tests were conducted to select suitable methods to treat combined sewer overflows. The initial overflow phase is probably caused by flushing of sewage in the lower reaches of the sewerage system. Generally initial overflows have the characteristics of raw sewage. During the second phase, a systematic scouring of materials in the sewer and on the surface appears to occur, and pollutant concentrations usually increase. The concentrations then drop to the steady third phase level. Relatively unpolluted surface runoff and normal sewage flow make up third phase discharges. The discharge rate has little effect on pollutant concentrations. The time of decrease to a steady level is virtually independent of system physiography and meteorological conditions. Differences between combined sewer overflows and urban storm runoff are small. Apparently, separation of sewers would not significantly reduce pollution of receiving waters. Wet weather discharges significantly affected coliform levels in waters proximate to combined sewer outfalls. Disinfecting combined sewer overflows will be necessary for receiving waters to meet recreational water quality requirements. Dissolved air flotation is potentially feasible as a means of treating combined sewer overflows. (Snyder-FIRL)},

	annote = {Environmental pollution that renders waters along the coastline and beaches unsatisfactory for use by the general public has become a global health problem. This study was conducted to examine the effects of pollution of beach waters and sediment at seven selected locations receiving land drainage along a 45-km stretch of the east coast near Visakhapatnam, India. Pathogenic bacteria were identified using standard methods of culturing on selective media. The Pollution Index (PI) was determined as the ratio of fecal coliform/fecal streptococci. Protozoan cysts and helminth ova were also identified by microscopic examination of water after appropriate staining. The results suggested that the beach waters in Visakhapatnam are hygienically poor. A high PI of the water in Lawson's Bay indicated that the water was unsuitable even for noncontact recreation (boating, etc.). Pathogen densities dissipated considerably from the source to the low tide mark. Sediments had significantly higher bacterial and protozoan populations but pathogen concentrations were low except in heavily used areas. The general distribution pattern suggests that the nature of the sediment has a significant role in the retention of bacteria, protozoan cysts, and soil-transmitted helminths. {\copyright}2003 Elsevier Inc.

This study examined the presence and proportions of the different subgroups of F+ coliphages in a variety of fecal wastes and surface waters with well-defined potential waste impacts. Municipal wastewater samples had high proportions of F+ DNA and group II and III F+ RNA coliphages. Bovine wastewaters also contained a high proportion of F+ DNA coliphages, but group I and IV F+ RNA coliphages predominated. Swine wastewaters contained approximately equal proportions of F+ DNA and RNA coliphages, and group I and III F+ RNA coliphages were most common. Waterfowl (gull and goose) feces contained almost exclusively F+ RNA coliphages of groups I and IV. No F+ coliphages were isolated from the feces of the other species examined. F+ coliphage recovery from surface waters was influenced by precipitation events and animal or human land use. There were no significant differences in coliphage density among land use categories. Significant seasonal variation was observed in the proportions of F+ DNA and RNA coliphages. Group I F+ RNA coliphages were the vast majority (90%) of those recovered from surface waters. The percentage of group I F+ RNA coliphages detected was greatest at background sites, and the percentage of group II F+ RNA coliphages was highest at human-impacted sites. Monitoring of F+ coliphage groups can indicate the presence and major sources of microbial inputs to surface waters, but environmental effects on the relative occurrence of different groups need to be considered.},

It represents a significant down payment on a multi-year effort to restore the Great Lakes and help revive the region's struggling economy. The Great Lakes Restoration Initiative is specifically targeted at the following priorities: * Cleaning up toxic substances and Areas of Concern ($147 million) * Preventing or removing aquatic invasive species ($60 million) * Improving nearshore health and preventing nonpoint source pollution ($98 million) * Restoring and protecting habitat and wildlife ($105 million) * Evaluating and monitoring progress ($65 million). The Great Lakes Restoration Initiative will be a multiagency effort led by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Funds are expected to be allocated strategically to implement both federal programs and projects implemented by states, tribes, municipalities, universities, and other organizations. EPA will transfer portions of the appropriated funding to other federal agencies for distribution. It is estimated that 60 percent or more of the funding will be distributed to nonfederal entities through existing contracts and grants as well as new programs. Funding under the Initiative is intended to build on, but not take the place of, existing federal activities. Federal agencies will be expected to maintain their current base level of funding for Great Lakes activities. The Initiative does not address wastewater and drinking water infrastructure activities, which will continue to be supported under the existing Clean Water and Drinking Water State Revolving Funds. The President's budget includes an additional $3.9 billion nationwide for these two programs.},

Percent infectivity of exposed oocysts was determined by in vitro cell culture. Artificial UV-B exposures of 32 and 66 kJ/m2 significantly decreased oocyst infectivity by an average of 58 and 98%, respectively. Exposure of oocysts to approximately half and full intensity of full solar spectrum (all wavelengths) for a period of less than 1 day (10 h) in mid-summer reduced mean infectivity by an average of 67% and >99.99%, respectively. Exposure of the C. parvum oocysts to UVshielded solar radiation (>404 nm) in early autumn reduced mean infectivity by 52%, while full spectrum solar radiation (exposure at all wavelengths) reduced mean infectivity by 97%. The data provide strong evidence that exposure to natural solar radiation can significantly reduce C. parvum infectivity.

Specifically, two mathematical models were developed, calibrated, and validated in an attempt to understand both the relative contributions of various outfall and shoreline sources to organism counts throughout Mamala Bay and the benefits achieved by various source control options. A three-dimensional hydrodynamic model was constructed to simulate the advective and dispersive processes observed in the bay. A near field plume model was coupled with the hydrodynamic model to realistically incorporate initial mixing dynamics. Results of the hydrodynamic model were then used by a pathogen fate model to predict the distributions of fecal contamination indicator organisms and specific pathogens at several locations throughout the bay. Two sources were identified as primary contributors of contamination within Mamala Bay: the outfall from the Sand Island wastewater treatment plant and the Ala Wai Canal. The relative importance of the sources was dependent on the indicator organism used to assess fecal contamination. Using the fate model results and assuming a seven consecutive day exposure, the maximum risk of infection at Waikiki Beach was estimated to be 1.3/100 for virus and 3.1/10,000 for Giardia. The upgrade of the Sand Island treatment plant to chemically-enhanced primary treatment reduced organism counts throughout the bay by about a factor of two. Additional reductions were achieved by adding disinfection or upgrading the plant to secondary treatment. The implementation of the evaluated source control options would reduce the risks of infection at Waikiki Beach.},

	annote = {Toxoplasma gondii affects a wide variety of hosts including threatened southern sea otters (Enhydra lutris nereis) which serve as sentinels for the detection of the parasite's transmission into marine ecosystems. Toxoplasmosis is a major cause of mortality and contributor to the slow rate of population recovery for southern sea otters in California. An updated seroprevalence analysis showed that 52{\%} of 305 freshly dead, beachcast sea otters and 38{\%} of 257 live sea otters sampled along the California coast from 1998 to 2004 were infected with T. gondii. Areas with high T. gondii exposure were predominantly sandy bays near urban centres with freshwater runoff. Genotypic characterisation of 15 new T. gondii isolates obtained from otters in 2004 identified only X alleles at B1 and SAG1. A total of 38/50 or 72{\%} of all otter isolates so far examined have been infected with a Type X strain. Type X isolates were also obtained from a Pacific harbor seal (Phoca vitulina) and California sea lion (Zalophus californianus). Molecular analysis using the C8 RAPD marker showed that the X isolates were more genetically heterogeneous than archetypal Type I, II and III genotypes of T. gondii. The origin and transmission of the Type X T. gondii genotype are not yet clear. Sea otters do not prey on known intermediate hosts for T. gondii and vertical transmission appears to play a minor role in maintaining infection in the populations. Therefore, the most likely source of infection is by infectious, environmentally resistant oocysts that are shed in the feces of felids and transported via freshwater runoff into the marine ecosystem. As nearshore predators, otters serve as sentinels of protozoal pathogen flow into the marine environment since they share the same environment and consume some of the same foods as humans. Investigation into the processes promoting T. gondii infections in sea otters will provide a better understanding of terrestrial parasite flow and the emergence of disease at the interface between wildlife, domestic animals and humans. {\copyright}2005 Australian Society for Parasitology Inc.

	annote = {Somatic coliphages, F-specific RNA bacteriophages, bacteriophages infecting Bacteroides fragilis, Escherichia coli and enterococci were counted in bathing waters in the late spring and summer. We tested fresh and marine bathing waters from North, South, East and West Europe expected to contain between 100 and 500 E. coli per 100 ml, although wider ranges were sometimes found. Bacteriophages were counted after concentration, since a preliminary study proved that this step was necessary to obtain positive counts. During monitoring, a first-line quality control with reference materials for bacteria and bacteriophages was performed by all the laboratories participating in the study. The same microbes were also counted in raw sewage samples from various areas in Europe, where the bacterial indicators and the three groups of bacteriophages were detected in roughly the same numbers. All groups of bacteriophages were detected in both fresh and marine bathing waters throughout Europe. Reliable and complete results from 147 samples showed that for log-transformed values, E. coli and bacteriophages were slightly correlated. However, the slope of the regression line changed according to E. coli concentration and the correlation diminished when this concentration was close to zero per 100 ml. The ratios between E. coli and phages in bathing waters differed significantly from those in sewage. The relative amounts of bacteriophages, mainly somatic coliphages and phages infecting Bact. fragilis RYC2056, increased in bathing waters with low E. coli concentration, especially in seawater samples containing < 100 E. coli per 100 ml. The relationship of bacteriophages with respect to enterococci paralleled that of bacteriophages with respect to E. coli. Somatic coliphages and bacteriophages infecting Bact. fragilis are useful to predict the presence of some pathogens with the same origin as present bacterial indicators but with higher survival rates.},

Several Bacteroides spp. have been suggested as potential alternative indicators. We have developed a rapid, culture-independent method for quantifying fecal Bacteroides spp. using quantitative PCR (QPCR) targeting the 16S rRNA gene. The assay specifically targets and quantifies the most common humanBacteroides spp. The details of the method are presented, including analyses of a wide range of fecal samples from different organisms. Specificity and performance of the QPCR assay were also tested via a laboratory experiment where human sewage and gull guano were inoculated into a range of environmental water samples. Concentrations of fecal Bacteroides spp., total Enterococcus sp., Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, and Enterococcus casseliflavus were measured using QPCR, and total Enterococcus sp. and E. coli were quantified by membrane filtration (MF). Samples spiked with gull guano were highly concentrated with total Enterococcus sp., E. coli, E. faecalis, and E. casseliflavus, demonstrating that these indicators are prominent in animal feces. On the other hand, fecal Bacteroides spp. concentrations were high in samples containing sewage and were relatively low in samples spiked with gull guano. Sensitivity and specificity results suggest that the rapid fecal Bacteroides spp. QPCR assay may be a useful tool to effectively predict the presence and concentration of human-specific fecal pollution.},

A simple spatially-explicit model was used to explore potential build-out conditions under different sets of regulations for the Barnegat Bay watershed, New Jersey, USA. Four build-out scenarios were created based on: (1) current regulations, (2) down zoning, (3) protecting a buffer around wetlands, and (4) open space protection. Various indicators were used to measure the impacts of build-out land use on: (1) water demand, (2) urban non-point source pollution, and (3) terrestrial habitat fragmentation. Potential change from 1995 to build-out and differences between the four build-out scenarios were identified based on the indicators. The analysis suggests that substantial changes will occur in the watershed before build-out, but that there is little difference between the four regulatory scenarios examined. In all cases, water demand is projected to exceed water supply, water quality is projected to be severely impacted in several locations, and terrestrial habitat will be further fragmented. Based on these results, the ability of regulatory approaches commonly used in the United States' coastal zones to protect water and terrestrial resources from future development should be questioned. {\copyright}2003 Elsevier B.V.

From people attending 12 Sydney beaches in the period from December 5, 1989 to February 26, 1990, we recruited a cohort of 8413 adults who agreed to participate in this study. Of these, 4424 were excluded either because they had been swimming in the previous 5 days or because they reported a current illness. Of the remainder, 2839 successfully completed a follow-up telephone interview conducted within 10 days after recruitment. We recorded reported respiratory, gastrointestinal, eye, and ear symptoms and fever that occurred within the 10 days between initial interview on the beach and the follow-up interview. Results. A total of 683 participants (24.0{\%}) reported experiencing symptoms in the 10 days following initial interview. Of these, 435 (63.7{\%}) reported respiratory symptoms. Swimmers were almost twice as likely as nonswimmers to report symptoms. There was a linear relationship between water pollution and all reported symptoms with the exception of gastrointestinal complaints. Conclusions. Swimmers at Sydney ocean beaches are more likely to report respiratory, ear, and eye symptoms than beachgoers who do not swim. The incidence of these symptoms increases slightly with increasing levels of pollution.},

Understanding the occurrence and variability of Cryptosporidium in a watershed is critical to the production of a safe drinking water supply. Essential to this undertanding is the ability to characterize potential sources of Cryptosporidium and predict their occurrence in a watershed. The purpose of the work described in this report is to define the relative magnitude and contributions of Cryptosporidium from major non-point sources defined by urban land use, rural land use and pont source wastewater discharges and to characterize contributions of each source by factors such as hydrograph timing, climatic effects, and seasonal variations. Samples from an urban stream consistently had higher Cryptosporidium concentrations than those from a rural/agricultural stream and wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents. Total contributions of Cryptosporidium oocysts from WWTP effluents to a large diverse watershed were found to be nearly insignificant compared to contributions from other sources. Runoff events play a significant role in the introduction of oocysts to a watershed. In order to properly assess the public health signivicance of Cryptosporidium oocysts in a watershed, sampling must be done during ruoff events as well as during non-event periods. Automated sampling methods are shown to be both practical and reliable for the evaluation of Cryptosporidium concentrations in a watershed. Statistical models are presented that can be used to estimate the probability of high Cryptosporidium levels from a given combination of conditions and may be useful for maximizing sampling strategies for watershed managers charged with understanding Cryptosporidium occurrence in the watershed.},

A risk assessment approach was used to determine their significance as a waterborne pathogen. There are 47 types of adenoviruses and the diseases resulting from infections include conjunctivitis, pharyngitis, pneumonia, acute and chronic appendicitis, exanthematous disease, bronchiolitis, acute respiratory disease, and gastroenteritis (types 40 and 41). Adenovirus is considered to be only second to rotavirus in terms of its significance as a pathogen of childhood gastroenteritis. Adenovirus infections are usually acute and self-limiting with a greater severity of illness occurring in the immunocompromised (e.g. AIDS patients and transplant recipients). They are reported to be more resistant to inactivation by UV than enteroviruses and are sometimes detected at higher levels in polluted waters. There are documented outbreaks of conjunctivitis due to adenovirus types 3 \& 4 associated with swimming in contaminated recreational waters. Based on the data obtained from human dose-response studies, the exponential model {$[$}P sub(i) = 1 -exp(-rN); r = 0.4172{$]$} was chosen for this risk assessment. Annual risks of infection in drinking water for adenovirus at average levels of 1/1,000L to 1/100L ranged from 8.3 /10,000 to 8.3/1,000, respectively.

Sepetiba Bay has a complicated geometry and bottom topography, and is located on the Brazilian coast near Rio de Janeiro. In the simulation, the dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration and biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) are used as indicators for the presence of organic matter in the body of water, and as parameters for evaluating the environmental pollution of the eastern part of Sepetiba Bay. Effluent sources in the model are taken from DO and BOD field measurements. The simulation results are consistent with field observations and demonstrate that the model has been correctly calibrated. The model is suitable for evaluating the environmental impact of sewage effluent on Sepetiba Bay from river inflows, assessing the feasibility of different treatment schemes, and developing specific monitoring activities. This approach has general applicability for environmental assessment of complicated coastal bays. {\copyright}2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	annote = {Cullera Bay, located on the Mediterranean coast of Spain, is influenced by the J{\'u}car River outflow and by an sewage outfall that discharges wastewaters in the vicinity of the river mouth. Within the framework of the ECOSUD project, five sampling campaigns were conducted between July 2002 and April 2003 at 11 stations distributed along the coast of the bay and in the area of the sewage pipe, in order to determine the spatial and temporal distribution of bacteria (faecal coliforms, enterococci and Escherichia coli) in the seawater and thus detect possible dangerous zones for recreational use of the beaches, based on the guidelines established by the European Environmental Commission. In general, Cullera Bay was found to have good water quality; however, the discharges from both the river and sewage outfall affect the coastal zone, the increase in bacterial concentration diminishing the quality of the bathing waters, especially during the summer months when tourism peaks. Moreover, as a result of additional inputs of sporadic sources of pollution in the area of Cape Cullera, the maximum permissible values established for faecal coliforms (2000 CFU 100 mL-1), enterococci (200 CFU 100 mL-1) and E. coli (500 CFU 100 mL-1) were exceeded. Considering that the currents are driven by seasonal winds, the northern area could eventually become an additional source of contaminating bacteria to the beaches that currently have good water quality.}

	annote = {Wet weather urban discharges are responsible for bathing water contamination. The proposal for a revised EU Directive concerning the quality of bathing water imposes significantly more stringent requirements for the management of bathing water quality, with particularly important repercussions on beaches subjected to short-term pollution incidents. The paper reviews the aspects from EU legislation most directly related to the problem of wet-weather discharges, placing special emphasis on the recent revision process of the Directive on bathing water quality, and evaluates the benefits of some potential solutions based on continuous modelling of a combined sewer system. Increasing the sewer system storage capacity or the STP hydraulic capacity may substantially reduce the untreated discharge volumes, but spill frequency reductions under 2 to 3 spill days per bathing season will hardly be achieved. Results show the severe strains that local rainfall patterns would place on compliance with the Commission's proposal for a revised Directive and highlight the importance of the changes introduced in the amended proposal recently approved by the Council, making it less prescriptive if adequate measures are adopted to prevent bathers' exposure to short-term pollution incidents. {\copyright}IWA Publishing 2005.},

The ultimate aim of the study was to test the reliability of the assay with a view to its use in the field to assess the compliance of coastal bathing waters with the guideline concentrations. The assay had a 99{\%} success rate at detecting pass/fail at 300 faecal coliforms per 100 ml, using a threshold fluorescence of 60.3 nM. A good correlation (r = 0.90) between faecal coliform concentration and fluorescence assay results was obtained. The assay provides a rapid, simple and inexpensive method for the detection of sewage pollution in marine waters, and with the aid of portable instrumentation, it may be performed in the field, allowing real time monitoring of water quality.},

The water was seeded with Enterococcus faecalis, Clostridium sporogenes spores, and P22 bacteriophage, each at ca 1 x 10^5 mL-1, and exposed to natural sunlight in 30-L reaction vessels. Water temperature ranged from 17 to 39 C during the experiments lasting up to 6 h. Dark controls showed little inactivation and so it was concluded that the inactivation observed was primarily driven by non-thermal processes. The optimised reactor design achieved S90 values (cumulative exposure required for 90% reduction) for the test microorganisms in the range 0.63--1.82 MJm-2 of Global Solar Exposure (GSX) without the need for TiO2 as a catalyst. High turbidity (840--920 NTU) only reduced the S90 value by <40%. Further, when all S90 means were compared this decrease was not statistically significant (prob. > 0.05). However, inactivation was significantly reduced for E. faecalis and P22 when the transmittance of UV wavelengths was attenuated by water with high colour (140 PtCo units) or a suboptimally transparent reactor lid (prob. < 0.05). S90 values were consistent with those measured by other researchers (ca 1--10 MJm-2) for a range of waters and microorganisms. Although temperatures required for SODIS type pasteurization were not produced, nonthermal inactivation alone appeared to offer a viable means for reliably disinfecting low colour source waters by greater than 4 orders of magnitude on sunny days at 34S latitude.},

Methods and Results: Inflow and outflow concentrations of somatic and f-specific RNA coliphages to two stormwater treatment systems were determined on 21 occasions over a period of 5 months. Somatic coliphages were detected in 19 (90%) of the constructed wetland inlet samples, 13 (62%) of the pond inlet samples, and less frequently at the outlets of the two systems. F-specific RNA coliphages were detected at the inlets but only occasionally at the pond outlet. Somatic coliphages were found to attach preferentially to particles <5 lm in size and persisted in the sediments of the two systems. Conclusions: Treatment systems providing conditions that are conducive to the settlement of fine particles may effectively remove sediment-bound coliphages and, therefore, possibly enteric viruses from stormwater. Significance and Impact of the Study: The results will aid the design of systems for effective removal of viral contaminants from urban stormwater.},

Recreational beaches are protected due to rapid initial and subsequent dilution of the sludges, sedimentation, and microbial die-off. Monitoring data show log decreases in microbial indicators from the 12-mile site to Long Island. After initial dilution of the discharged wastes, waters of the 12-mile site would meet New York and New Jersey standards for marine recreational waters.

	annote = {The influence of fortnightly spring-neap tidal variability on submarine discharge of fresh and saline groundwater was examined at Stinson Beach, California. Stinson Beach is a residential community that utilizes on-site systems for wastewater disposal. Fresh, shallow groundwater at the site contains high concentrations of nutrients (dissolved inorganic nitrogen {$[$}DIN{$]$}, soluble reactive phosphate {$[$}SRP{$]$}, and silicate) and human fecal bacteria. A groundwater-derived freshening and nutrification of the surf zone during neap tides was observed, followed by a 4-d increase in chlorophyll a concentrations. Analytical models and a freshwater budget in the surf zone were used to estimate the saline and fresh discharge of submarine groundwater. We estimate fresh groundwater discharge between 1.2 and 4.7 L min-1 m-1 shoreline during neap tides compared with 0.1 and 0.5 L min-1 m -1 during spring tides. This compares with 15.9 and 22.0 L min -1 m-1 saline groundwater discharge (forced by waves and tides) during neap and spring tides, respectively. Despite the smaller total (fresh + saline) flux of groundwater during neap compared with spring tides, the larger fresh discharge component during neap tides raises surf zone silicate, DIN, and SRP by 14{\%}, 35{\%}, and 27{\%}, respectively, relative to spring tides. This observed fortnightly pulsing of fresh groundwater-derived nutrients was consistent with seaward hydraulic gradients across the fresh part of the beach aquifer, which varied due to aquifer overheight near the beach face. Darcy-Dupuit estimates of seaward fresh groundwater flow in this area agreed well with the fresh discharge results of the mass balance. {\copyright}2008, by the American Society of Limnology and Oceanography, Inc.},

In the Danube bend area a substantial discrepancy was found in the bacterial contamination of the two banks. The drifting out of contamination to the left bank was confirmed by cross section tests as well.

About 5{\%} of the capital's waste waters is admitted by the Rackevei Branch of the Danube. By testing water and warp in the upper 30-35 km section it was found that the heavy waste water load is counteracted by beneficial self purification, so that in the lower 20 km section between Kiskunlachaza and Tass the water is qualified as suitable for swimming. In this area the incidence rate of Salmonella was zero or low. On the strength of these results an upper limit of tolerated Salmonella incidence is suggested: if a waste water admitting river serves for recreation too, the incidence rate of Salmonella should not exceed 33{\%} in serially tested samples.},

The median enterococcal numbers of 5 samples collected from each site over each season were compared to the guideline medians: 35 and 33 enterococci per 100 ml for marine and fresh waters, respectively. The "5-sample median" values generally agreed with longer-term medians (n = 24, 28) from river and estuary sites sampled between 1990 and 1994. During the summers of 1991 and 1993, high enterococcal numbers at marine and lake swimming sites were assumed to be derived primarily from sewage effluent and farm run-off, either directly or from freshwater inflows. Enterococcal numbers dropped significantly in these waters when effluents were either treated or removed from the waters. In 1995, all marine bathing waters complied with the guideline value of 35 enterococci per 100 ml. Evidence from long-term monitoring of estuary sites indicated that most marine bathing sites have high-quality bathing water with short-term variability caused by winds, tides, and outfall discharges. In 1995, all but one lake site complied with the freshwater median guideline of 33 enterococci per 100 ml. Most upstream river sites also complied with the freshwater guideline. However, river sites in the mid reaches and down stream recorded high enterococcal numbers which increased slightly at some sites from 1992 to 1995. The most significant increase in bacterial numbers was recorded in the small river and stream swimming holes which carry low volumes of water (< 1000 1 s-1), particularly in the western area of Lake Rotorua.

This investigation sought to confirm whether or not the paper mill was the pollution source, and to characterize the risk to recreational bathers imposed by the source. Methods and Results: Quantification of E. coli in river water collected at incremental distances showed that paper mill effluent caused elevated E. coli levels in beach samples. Samples collected throughout the mill were variably positive for heterotrophic bacteria, total coliforms and E. coli, but negative for pathogenic E. coli O157 and Salmonella. Escherichia coli O157 or Salmonella spiked into mill samples (4.2 log10 or 5.6 log 10 CFU per 100 ml, respectively) fell below detection levels within 14-24 h in raw (unaltered) samples, while in heat-sterilized replicates, the counts remained at initial levels or increased over 36 h. Conclusions: Pathogenic E. coli O157 and Salmonella were not isolated from paper mill samples. The absence of native bacteria allowed the survival of pathogens, while their presence accelerated pathogen decline.

This applies primarily to drinking water, be it bottled water or water from a public supply system, but is equally important for the analysis of water from swimming pools and beaches, and ballast water from oceangoing ships discharging into coastal or inland waters of the US. There are several methods available today for a rapid test including PCR based methods, flow cytometry, and electrochemiluminescence, to name a few. All of the above methods work, but are complicated and/or require expensive equipment and highly trained analysts in a laboratory. The method described here is based on lysing the bacteria after capture on membrane filter, and measuring the ATP in a luminometer after the addition of luciferine/luciferase. This bioluminescence test can be done onsite, in less than 5 minutes, with equipment that fits onto a clipboard. It is a fast screening test that indicates if there is enough biologically active material in the sample to pose a threat to the consumer. If this is the case, an additional step using immunomagnetic separation may be used to identify the responsible organisms. Tests have been done with E.coli O157:H7, pseudomonas, and legionella. These tests take about 30 minutes each, and allow a quick determination of bacterial threats in a field situation.},

This study, which confirms the circulation of Legionella in our region of southern Italy, extends the list of the possible sources of infection, including also public and private beaches among the contaminated sites. It is the Authors opinion that when evaluating the risk in these cases we should take into account that the crowding of the beaches in the summer months and the communal nature of shower use in these periods increases the frequency of exposure of children and old people. These vulnerable categories are significantly more likely to develop the disease once infected.},

	annote = {The potential regrowth of fecal indicator bacteria released into coastal environments in recreational water bodies has been of concern, especially in tropical and subtropical areas where the number of these bacteria can be artificially elevated beyond that from fecal impacts alone. The task of determining the factors that influence indicator bacterial regrowth was addressed though a series of field sampling and laboratory experiments using in situ densities of Escherichia coli, enterococci, and Clostridium perfringens in river water, sediment, and soil. Field sampling efforts included the collection of surface sediments along the cross section of a riverbank, a 20-cm-deep soil core, and additional surface soils from remote locations. In addition to field sampling, two types of laboratory experiments were conducted. The first experiment investigated the survival of bacteria already present in river water with the addition of sterile and unsterile sediment. The second experiment was designed to simulate the wetting and drying effects due to tidal cycles. The results from the sampling study found elevated numbers of E. coli and C. perfringens in surficial sediments along the riverbank near the edge of the water. C. perfringens was found in high numbers in the subsurface samples obtained from the soil core. Results from laboratory experiments revealed a significant amount of regrowth for enterococci and E. coli with the simulation of tides and addition of sterile sediment. Regrowth was not observed for C. perfringens. This study demonstrates the need to further evaluate the characteristics of indicator microbes within tropical and subtropical water systems where natural vegetation, soil embankments, and long-term sediment accumulation are present. In such areas, the use of traditional indicator microbes to regulate recreational uses of a water body may not be appropriate.},

This is particularly true, where human waste and other animal faecal sources have been eliminated as the pollution source. A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) marker was developed as a duck-specific marker of faecal pollution. The semi-nested primer system targeted an unknown bacterium (E2) isolated from mallard ducks. E2 had the closest 16S rRNA sequence similarity to members of the Desulfovibrio genus, which was further confirmed by phenotypic characterisation of the bacterium. Testing of the prevalence of E2 identified the marker in 76{\%} of duck faecal samples (n=42), 20{\%} of swan faecal samples (n=10) and 15{\%} of Canada geese faecal samples (n=20). It was also identified in the faeces of two out of 15 domestic goats (13{\%}). The marker was not detected in any samples derived from human faeces or effluent, dairy cows or sheep. It is proposed that this PCR marker would be useful in conjunction with faecal taxation indicators in the determination of pollution derived from duck faecal inputs in waterways.},

World Bank assisted Bombay Sewage Disposal Project (BSDP) undertaken by the Municipal Corporation of Bruhan Mumbai (MCBM) envisaged sewage discharges through marine outfalls at Worli and Bandra and treatment by aerated lagoons for other areas before disposal in creeks. During BSDP programme, studies were undertaken on water quality assessment along the west coast of Mumbai before and after commissioning of the Worli outfall. A pre- and post-commissioning water quality database for selected parameters was generated for near shore as well as west coast region up to 5 km seaward distance to assess the efficacy of the Worli outfall and delineate the areas affected around diffuser location of the outfall due to sewage disposal. This paper presents observations of the coastal studies at Mumbai and the impact zone of Worli outfall. {\copyright}2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	annote = {A new library-based microbial source tracking (MST) approach intended for initial application in the coastal waters of Virginia was evaluated. Host-origin isolates of Enterococcus spp. were collected from beaches and the surrounding tidewater region of Virginia and used to construct a library based on the pattern of DNA band lengths produced by the amplification of the 16S-23S rDNA intergenic spacer (IGS) region, and subsequent digestion with MboI. Initial results from small host-origin libraries (64 and 200 total isolates) with discriminant analysis (DA) and logistic regression (LR) yielded high average rates of correct classification (ARCC) for a four-source classification split (birds, dogs, sewage, and wildlife), with ARCCs ranging from 83 to 100{\%}. However, the poor results obtained when classification was attempted on a non-library validation set (VS, ARCCs of 47 and 48{\%}, respectively, using DA and LR) demonstrated that a library of 200 isolates was insufficient to adequately represent the diversity of the enterococci in the sampled region. An increase in the library size to 1029 total isolates was accompanied by a reduction in the ARCC of the library to 42.7{\%} with DA and 45.7{\%} with LR, plus similarly poor results obtained from the VS. The low correct classification rates generated by the larger known-source library were unsuitable for field application. Many reported MST methods have been based on results obtained using small host-origin libraries without external validation. Our results indicate that such an approach can be very misleading, and that larger libraries and external validation is essential for the confirmation of preliminary results.

We also examined the performance of method 1623 under ambient conditions with matrix spike experiments using 10 organisms/liter. Under turbid conditions, the HV capsule filtered approximately twice the volume filtered by the standard filter, but neither could filter 10 liters without clogging. In low-turbidity waters, oocyst, but not cyst, recoveries were significantly higher when the HV capsule was used. In turbid waters, organism recoveries were lower than those in nonturbid waters and were not significantly different for the different filters. When the HV capsule was used, Cryptosporidium recoveries ranged from 36 to 75%, and Giardia recoveries ranged from 0.5 to 53%. For both organisms, recoveries varied significantly by site. Turbidity could explain variation in Giardia recoveries (r2 $ 0.80) but not variation in Cryptosporidium recoveries (r2 $ 0.16). The inconsistent recoveries across sites suggested that the background matrix of the ambient water affected recovery by method 1623. A control sample collected at the height of the winter rainy season detected one organism, highlighting the difficulty of using this method to accurately measure pathogen abundance under natural conditions. Our findings support the use of the HV filter under field conditions but suggest that designing a cost-effective and statistically valid monitoring program to evaluate sources and loads of protozoan pathogens may be difficult.},

Two of the lagoons treated domestic sewage; the third, meat processing waste and the fourth, meat processing waste with a minor sewage component. In the meat processing lagoons the ratios of FRNA:FDNA were numerically large, due to very low counts of FDNA, and somatic coliphages generally outnumbered FRNA. Many of the FDNA plaques from meat processing lagoons were very small and were not confirmed on the F-plus strain, E. coli C 3000. In sewage lagoons all three coliphages were consistently present and FRNA usually outnumbered both FDNA and somatic coliphages. However, the ratios of FRNA to the other two coliphages were not numerically large. Ratios of coliphages, especially of FRNA:FDNA, seem a promising tool to distinguish between human and animal faecal pollution.

Of the five human-specific PCR assays, the assay targeting the Bifidobacterium catenulatum group was the most promising, exhibiting a sensitivity of 100{\%} (with human sewage samples) and a specificity of 87{\%}. When tested on rural water samples that were naturally contaminated by ruminant feces, the three novel PCR assays tested positive with a much greater percentage (52--87{\%}) of samples than the existing ruminant-specific assay (17{\%}).

For this purpose, the U.S. EPA has been conducting epidemiologic studies to establish relationships between microbial measures of water quality and adverse health outcomes among swimmers. New methods for testing water quality that would provide same-day results will likely be elements of the new criteria. Although the epidemiologic studies upon which the criteria will be based were conducted at Great Lakes and marine beaches, the new water quality criteria may be extended to inland waters (IWs). Similarities and important differences between coastal waters (CWs) and IWs that should be considered when developing criteria for IWs were the focus of an expert workshop. Here, we summarize the state of knowledge and research needed to base IWs microbial criteria on sound science. Two key differences between CWs and IWs are the sources of indicator bacteria, which may modify the relationship between indicator microbes and health risk, and the relationship between indicators and pathogens, which also may vary within IWs. Monitoring using rapid molecular methods will require the standardization and simplification of analytical methods, as well as greater clarity about their interpretation.

Objectives: We hypothesize an association between rainfall and pediatric emergency department (ED) visits for AGI that may represent an unrecognized, endemic burden of pediatric disease in a major U.S. metropolitan area served by municipal drinking water systems. Methods: We conducted a retrospective time series analysis of visits to the Children's Hospital of Wisconsin ED in Wauwatosa, Wisconsin. Daily visit totals of discharge International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision codes of gastroenteritis or diarrhea were collected along with daily rainfall totals during the study period from 2002 to 2007. We used an autoregressive moving average model, adjusting for confounding variables such as sewage release events and season, to look for an association between daily visits and rainfall after a lag of 1--7 days. Results: A total of 17,357 AGI visits were identified (mean daily total, 7.9; range, 0--56). Any rainfall 4 days prior was significantly associated with an 11% increase in AGI visits. Expected seasonal effects were also seen, with increased AGI visits in winter months. Conclusions: We observed a significant association between rainfall and pediatric ED visits for AGI, suggesting a waterborne component of disease transmission in this population. The observed increase in ED visits for AGI occurred in the absence of any disease outbreaks reported to public health officials in our region, suggesting that rainfall-associated illness may be underestimated. Further study is warranted to better address this association.},

Piezometers were installed near active leach lines at 20 sites among 9 Ohio counties. Despite an unusually wet year, water samples could not be obtained from piezometers at eight sites; at 5 of the other 12 sites, water could be obtained from only one piezometer. Water samples from the piezometers were analyzed for nutrients, chloride, and Escherichia coli ( E. coli ) bacteria to determine whether untreated wastewater was migrating away from the systems. Additional water samples were collected at two sites and analyzed for nitrogen isotopes and wastewater compounds. At three sites, bacteria were analyzed by means of repetitive DNA element polymerase chain reaction (rep-PCR) to indicate the source of the bacteria. Nitrate concentrations ranged from 0.2 to 25.9 milligrams per liter (mg/L) but exceeded 10 mg/L, an indication of wastewater influence, at only two sites. Chloride concentrations ranged from 18.4 to 1,150 mg/L; concentrations in excess of 200 mg/L, which may indicate some influence of wastewater, were found at five sites. E. coli were found in water from piezometers at three sites. Water samples from two of these E. coli -positive sites were analyzed for nitrogen isotopes and wastewater compounds. The nitrate concentrations were too low for accurate isotopic analysis; however, various wastewater compounds were found in samples from both sites, indicating wastewater movement. The rep-PCR process provided evidence of a linkage between the bacteria from HSTS to bacteria found in piezometers at several sites and to a curtain drain. The results of the water quality and rep-PCR analysis indicate that untreated wastewater can move laterally several feet from HSTS to the piezometers.},

Metolachlor, metribuzin, prometone, simazine, 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), and dichlorprop (2,4-DP) were also detected at some surface-water sites. One pesticide, 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4,5-T), was detected in two monitoring wells. Additionally, routine USGS monitoring through the early 1990's indicated the Pigeon River in Huron County to have some of the highest levels of nitrate-nitrogen and dissolved solids of any monitored river in Michigan (Blumer and others, 1992). Recently, new methods of chemical and biological analysis have been developed that allow better evaluation of the nature and source of contamination of water. Eleven Huron County townships have passed a resolution calling for evaluation of water quality in Huron County. In 2004 Huron County desired a survey of current water quality in their county. In cooperation with Huron County, the USGS collected water samples for analysis of microbiological, chemical and physical constituents from the Pinnebog and Pigeon River watersheds in Huron County from April through November, 2004 to assess the current state of Huron County's water quality.},

Th is study determined the occurrence of Shiga-toxin producing Escherichia coli (STEC) markers and their relation to FIB concentrations in Michigan and Indiana river water. Using 67 fecal coliform (FC) bacteria cultures from 41 river sites in multiple watersheds, we evaluated the occurrence of fi ve STEC markers: the Escherichia coli (EC) O157 antigen and gene, and the STEC virulence genes eaeA, stx1, and stx2. Simple isolations from selected FC cultures yielded viable EC O157. By both antigen and gene assays, EC O157 was detected in a greater proportion of samples exceeding rather than meeting FC RWQC (P < 0.05), but was unrelated to EC and enterococci RWQC. Th e occurrence of all other STEC markers was unrelated to any FIB RWQC. Th e eaeA, stx2, and stx1 genes were found in 93.3, 13.3, and in 46.7% of samples meeting FC RWQC and in 91.7, 0.0, and 37.5% of samples meeting the EC RWQC. Although not statistically signifi cant, the percentage of samples positive for each STEC marker except stx1 was lower in samples that met, as opposed to exceeded, FIB RWQC. Viable STEC were common members of the FC communities in river water throughout southern Michigan and northern Indiana, regardless of FIB RWQC. Our study indicates that further information on the occurrence of pathogens in recreational waters, and research on alternative indicators of their occurrence, may help inform water-resource management and public health decision-making.},

Data show beaches next to rivers had the highest bacterial levels in both wet and dry seasons. Bacterial levels rose substantially across all sites during wet months, and river discharge and bacterial levels were all highest during the winter with the most rainfall. Precipitation was significantly associated (Spearman rank bivariate correlation, P < 0.01) with water discharged from the rivers. River discharge was significantly associated with bacterial levels at 20 out of 22 beaches, with the strongest associations at sites next to rivers. The results indicate that urban river discharge is a primary source of Southern California's coastal water pollution and, as a result, swimming at beaches near rivers may pose a significant public health risk.

E. coli concentrations were highest in wet foreshore sand (114,000 CFU/g dry sand) and ankle-depth water (177,000 CFU/100 mL), declining rapidly in deeper waters. Many gull and geese droppings were enumerated each week on the foreshore sand within 2 m of the waterline. Both antimicrobial resistance analysis and rep-PCR DNA fingerprinting of E. coli collected at the beach and nearby fecal pollution sources indicated that E. coli in sand and water samples were predominantly from bird droppings rather than from pet droppings or municipal wastewater. Both methods indicated a trend of decreasing bird contamination, and increasing wastewater contamination, moving offshore from the beach. When foreshore sand was treated as a reservoir and secondary source of E. coli, waterborne E. coli were found to be more similar to sand isolates than bird or wastewater isolates out to 150 m offshore. Multiple lines of evidence indicated the importance of bird droppings and foreshore sand as primary and secondary sources of E. coli contamination in beach water at Bayfront Park.},

In a risk-based approach to this problem, the risk to swimmers' health is assessed by field monitoring of indicator bacteria and the associated risks are managed by source controls and other remedial measures. In risk assessment, great advances have been made in recent years with the introduction of microbial source tracking (MST) techniques. Two such techniques, antibiotic resistance analysis and DNA fingerprinting, were applied in a study of causes of faecal contamination at two lake beaches in Toronto, Ontario. Both methods identified bird faeces as the dominant sources of E. coli. Coping with this type of pollution presents a major environmental challenge. {\copyright}IWA Publishing 2007.},

As part of these studies, dilution and dispersion calculations were performed using the visitation frequency approach. In this paper variations of the visitation frequency method are discussed. Traditional visitation frequency analyses give the probability that a target area will be visited by the plume center-line. A modification is to calculate the fraction of the time that a target point is immersed in the plume. Also, the fraction of time that given bacterial concentrations are exceeded can be calculated. Further, the concentration-frequency distribution (exposure assessment) can be combined with the dose-response curve to give the risk of infection. These aspects of visitation analysis are illustrated with examples from Mount Maunganui and the North Shore (Auckland).},

Due to limited information available concerning human shedding of these microbes, this study focused on estimating the amounts of enterococci and S. aureus shed by bathers directly off their skin and indirectly via sand adhered to skin. Two sets of experiments were conducted at a marine beach located in Miami-Dade County, Florida. The first study, referred to as the "large pool" study, involved 10 volunteers who immersed their bodies in 4700 L during four 15 min cycles with exposure to beach sand in cycles 3 and 4. The "small pool" study involved 10 volunteers who were exposed to beach sand for 30 min before they individually entered a small tub. After each individual was rinsed with off- shore marine water, sand and rinse water were collected and analyzed for enterococci. Results from the "large pool" study showed that bathers shed concentrations of enterococci and S. aureus on the order of 6x10 super(5) and 6x10 super(6) colony forming units (CFU) per person in the first 15 min exposure period, respectively. Significant reductions in the bacteria shed per bather (50{\%} reductions for S. aureus and 40{\%} for enterococci) were observed in the subsequent bathing cycles. The "small pool" study results indicated that the enterococci contribution from sand adhered to skin was small (about 2{\%} of the total) in comparison with the amount shed directly from the bodies of the volunteers. Results indicated that bathers transport significant amounts of enterococci and S. aureus to the water column, and thus human microbial bathing load should be considered as a non-point source when designing recreational water quality models.},

	annote = {At the moment of examination, the bacteriological quality of water is not, to a large extent, more than an a posteriori evaluation: the population is advised afterwards that it had been exposed to a sanitary risk. The ideal situation for managing aquatic environments of recreational use would be to be able to predict at any moment their bacteriological quality. An approach would be to develop predictive models to relate the exceedance (number of days during which the bacteriological indicator exceeds the standards) with environmental variables. Studies were carried out at two beaches with different limnological characteristics, a fluvial beach and a lacustrine beach, from the beginning of 1998 to the end of 2000, so that it was possible to obtain information on the impact of very different hydroclimatic situations on microorganisms of sanitary interest (Escherichia coli and cyanobacteria). Three variables, maximum concentration of E. coli, rains and water level, justified 92.6{\%} of the exceedance variance in the multiple regression model at the fluvial beach. Other abiotic variables (temperature, pH, conductivity, transparency and dissolved oxygen) showed collinearity problems or did not make statistically significant contributions to the model. During the El Ni{\~n}o event (gauge heights >5 m) there were no exceedances after the rains, even with precipitations of 200 mm. Moreover, cyanobacteria density remained low (x = 1.191 $\pm$0.703 log10cian/ml). During the negative pluvial anomalies, although the exceedances of E. coli were not veryfrequent at both beaches due to the scarce rains, a massive development of cyanobacteda was produced (x = 4.657 $\pm$0.578 log10 cian/ml) at the lacustrine beach. At this beach, the mean decay coefficient (K) for E. coli was significantly (p 30 days) of droughts. Regression models obtained to predict the exceedance of E. coli were simplified using only three abiotic variables (water level, rains and DWR). Although, in this way, the percentage of explanation of the exceedance is lower (78.5{\%}), the information needed for the model is obtained quickly and preventive measures can be carried out immediately while waiting for more information.},

	annote = { The nature of the seasonal distributiorE of certain physical properties of sediments on the beach and shallow shelf area between two submarine canyon heads was studied at Scripps Institution of Oceanography. The investigation was made from five series of bottom samples obtained periodically from June 19h9 to May 1950 along a predetermined grid. Each series consisted of about 130 samples extending from the beach foreshore out to depths of approximately 200 feet. The emphasis in the laboratory analysis of the sediments was on the distribution of particle size. Other properties such as shape, roundness, heavy mineral and carbonate content were also measured. Topographic surveys showing the changes in sand level were made concurrently and on the same grid as the sediment sampling operations. These surveys indicate that beach material migrates seaward during period of large waves and landward during small waves. The most pronounced changes in sand level occur in depths less than 30 feet, but some seasonal effects may extend to greater depths. The greatest change in sediment size also took place from the beach "foreshore out to depths of about 30 feet. In this zone the sediments tended to be coarser during the winter and spring when the beaches were cut back, and finer in the fall following the summer fill. The areal distribution of physical properties indicated that the sediments varied in a systematic manner from one locality to another. It was found that the sediments could be divided into types on a basis of particle-size distribution, and that these types were characteristic of the environment of deposition. The beach and intercanyon sediments were grouped into three general environmental types. Type I consists of beach foreshore sands, which were the best sorted sediments in the area. Sands from the surf zone were designed as Type IIa, and were characteristically coarser and more poorly sorted than sediments farther inshore or offshore. These grade into Type lIb which were found on the relatively level portions of the shelf from the surf zone out to depths of approximately 1 100 feet. Type IIb sediments are predominantly well sorted, very fine sands. Type III sediments are found seaward of Type II b in areas where the bottom slopes more than about 1 in 15. These "slope" sediments usually have more silt, and are characterized by positive skewness and poorer sorting. During times of large waves sedimant is lost to the area by transportation into the submarine canyons. Replenishment of this sediment is apparently due to transport around the head of the northern of the two submarine canyons, since the sand along the beach for five miles north of the canyon head is very similar to that in the intercanyon area and the littoral drift here is to the south. A much coarser and better rounded sand is found on the pocket beaches and on the shelf south of the southern canyon head.},

	annote = {E. coli is an indicator of recent fecal contamination of freshwater beaches around the Great Lakes region. Elevated concentrations indicate that a fecal contamination has occurred, and that the risk for contact with fecal pathogenic organisms is heightened. The green algae, Cladophora, harbors populations of E. coli and potentially allows for prolonged survival and even replication of the bacterium in the lake environment. If presence of Cladophora mats on beaches is associated with persistence of E. coli in beach water, then E. coli would be a useful indicator organism only if pathogens also were able to survive and persist in the algae. This study utilized lab microcosms to study the persistence of E. coli, and of the fecal pathogens, Salmonella and Shigella, in lake water with and without the presence of Cladophora. E. coli was able to persist for extended periods in the presence of Cladophora (attached to algal mats for 45 days). Salmonella and Shigella, however, were unable to persist for this time period while in the presence of Cladophora (Salmonella attached to Cladophora was detectable for 10 days and Shigella was detectable for only 2 days). These data imply that E. coli is able to survive in the presence of Cladophora for greater times than are the fecal pathogens and that E. coli may not be an appropriate indicator organism for beaches with accumulations of algal material.},

Because of this problem, together with the difficulty in extrapolating pathogenic response between species, and the ability of microbes to adapt rapidly, confidence-level-dependent assessments of Cryptosporidium parvum dose-response have been developed. However, these results, even on a relative basis, are dependent on confidence level, and the lack of scientific basis for this choice hampers efforts to set water quality standards. Therefore, a predictive Bayesian dose-response assessment method was proposed previously. In this article, a hierarchical predictive population dose-response Bayesian assessment for C. parvum is presented for the infection endpoint. Available data on the infectivity of three isolates of C. parvum, genotype C, were adjusted for sensitive and antibody-positive subpopulations not proportionately represented in the data, by bootstrap analysis. The diverse mean infectivities of the isolates were used to obtain a predictive distribution for population infectivity, used in turn to obtain the predictive population dose-response function. The predictive result is a distribution of unconditional probability of infection, based on available dose-response information. Information includes theoretical and empirical evidence for the conditional beta-Poisson parametric dose-response function. Results indicate that a dose of 6× 10−6 oocysts per exposure corresponds to 10−4 infections per capita year. An allowable dose corresponding to goals of the SWTR should be increased over this value to reflect the illness endpoint, while potentially being reduced to account for secondary transmission among hosts if important for gastroenteritis in developed countries.},

The efficiency of organic flocculation and PEG precipitation to reconcentrate Ead 40 from beef extract eluents was also assessed. Viral assays were conducted by the TCIDs0 method in PLC/PRF/5 cells. With electronegative filters, recovery efficiencies of 36, 38, and 22% were obtained from 113-1. volumes of tap, sea water, and secondary sewage, respectively, using electropositive filters Ead 40 was recovered from tap water, with an efficiency of 26.5%. No significant difference was observed, by paired t-test analysis, when comparing the concentration efficiencies between organic flocculation (38.6%), and PEG precipitation (40%). These results show that Ead 40 can be concentrated from water samples, with efficiencies comparable to other enteric viruses.},

The role of the enteric adenoviruses as waterborne pathogens has not been evaluated. This study compared the survival of these agents with poliovirus type 1 (polio I) and the hepatitis A virus (HAV) in tap water at 4$\,^{\circ}$C, and at room temperature, with polio 1 in primary and secondary wastewater at 4, and 15$\,^{\circ}$C, and in sea water at 15$\,^{\circ}$C. Assays were conducted at regular intervals by the TCIDs0 method in PLC/PRF/5 cells. The survival of Ead 40 and Ead 41 in primary and secondary wastewater was slightly greater than that of polio 1. However, in tap, and sea water, the enteric adenoviruses were substantially more stable than either polio 1 or HAV. These results suggest that the enteric adenoviruses may survive for prolonged periods in water, representing a potential route of transmission.},

To detect the pollution, regulation throughout the world stipulates monitoring of faecal indicator bacteria. In EU, according to the new Bathing Water Directive compliance necessitates measurements of E. coli and Enterococci. Besides, the Directive demands timely and adequate warnings of the public during short-term contaminations. In Denmark operational modelling systems are already used to fulfil such requirement. Our talk will demonstrate the application of dynamic simulations in Bathing Water Forecasting as well as in measure investment planning. Other micro-organisms are natural for the environment and only become a threat to humans when growth conditions promote their growth. For example increased nutrient loadings support blooms of potential toxic cyanobacteria. High water temperatures combined with suitable salinities endorse growth of Vibrio vulnificus, V. cholerae and other natural occurring pathogenic bacteria. As for humanoid contamination, dynamic modelling presents a powerful tool for forecasting and for investigating causes and impact of measures.

Although several molecular techniques have been developed to rapidly detect bacteria in complex matrices, the challenge to simultaneously detect and enumerate only viable cells remains a limiting factor to their routine application. This chapter describes the use of peroxidase-labeled peptide nucleic acid (PNA) probes to simultaneously detect and count live Staphylococcus aureus, a human pathogen in sea water and beach sand. Mixed bacteria from the environmental sample were immobilized on polyvinylidene difluoride membrane filters and allowed to form microcolonies during a 5-h incubation on Tryptic soy agar plates. PNA probes targeting species-specific regions of the 16S rRNA sequences of S. aureus were then used to hybridize the target bacteria in situ. Probes were detected by capturing chemiluminiscence on instant (e.g., Polaroid) films. Each viable cell (i.e., rRNA producing) is detected as a light spot from its microcolony on the film after scanning the image into a computer. This rapid in situ hybridization technique is simple and highly sensitive and could be developed into portable kits for monitoring pathogens and indicators in the environment.},

The simultaneous detection and enumeration of eubacteria and the novel indicators, Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, was achieved within 6-8 h of processing. Following 5 h of incubation on TSA, soybean peroxidase-labeled peptide nucleic acid probes (Boston Probes, Boston, MA) targeting species-specific 16S rRNA sequences of P. aeruginosa and S. aureus were used to hybridize microcolonies of the target species in-situ. In addition, a universal probe for 16S rRNA sequences was used to target the eubacteria. Probes were detected after a light generating reaction with a chemiluminescent substrate and their presence recorded on Polaroid film. The probes showed limited cross-reactivity with mixed indigenous bacteria extracted from seawater and sand by shaking with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Specificity and cross-reactivity was tested on the reference bacterial genera Pseudomonas, Staphylococcus, Vibrio, Shigella, Salmonella, Acinetobacter, Enterobacter, Escherichia and Citrobacter. These tests confirmed that the probes were specific for the microorganisms of interest and were unaffected by high salt levels. The results of the PNA chemiluminescent in situ hybridization were compared with traditional plate count methods (PCM) for total freshwater' eubacteria, S. aureus and P. aeruginosa. Counts of eubacteria and S. aureus were comparable with numbers obtained from traditional plate counts but levels of P. aeruginosa were higher with PNA than with PCM. It is possible that PNA is more sensitive than PCM because it can detect microcolonies on the agar surface that never fully develop with the plate count method. We conclude that the in situ hybridization technique used here represents an important potential tool for the rapid monitoring of novel indicator organisms in beaches and recreational waters.},

Accepted measures of the demand for public goods, including hedonic price equations for land, Hotelling travel-cost measures, and others are seen to be special cases of a single methodology.

In spite of these monitored data no effective correlation to data from the concerning ambulant sector of medical care could be established. The Carinthian Sentinel Practice Network started in summer 1994 to retrieve informations about occurrence and frequency of bathing related illness of children up to 16 years old. The 26 participating primary health care and pediatric physicians, having their own independent practices spread all over the country, reported the specific doctor-patient-contracts to the coordinating base. Criteria for inclusion in the medical report were headache, sore throat, otalgia, stomach-ache, nausea, emesis, diarrhoea, fever, rhinitis, cough, cold, moreover conjunctivitis, skin rash and specific dermatitis. In addition physicians reported where, how long and how often the children had been bathing and how long they had been free of symptoms afterwards. Each case was reported to the coordinating base including a presumed diagnosis. Statistic evaluation showed that bathing related illness may be divided into three main groups according to symptom frequency. The frequency of otalgia (32.4{\%}) was significantly higher than any other symptom asked for. Two groups of symptoms correlate with each other: on one hand rhinitis, conjunctivitis, cough and sore throat (36.5{\%}) and on the other hand nausea, emesis, diarrhoea and fever (41.9{\%}). These data underline conclusions drawn by other authors but are not representative enough to correlate to data from water monitoring. First results suggest that conclusions for public health authorities can be drawn from this additional information about the state of the lakes and ponds-providing a sufficient number of data is reported.},

The high levels of fecal indicators may be caused by the loss or the reduced activities of common environmental stresses controlling die-off in the sand. Microcosm experiments were conducted to compare the effects of biotic stresses from autochthonous sand bacteria, protozoa, and viruses on Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis in two tropical beach sands. The inhibition of protozoan activities by cycloheximide did not significantly affect the die-off of E. coli, indicating that protozoan predation played a limited role in beach sand. The contribution from phage infection to E. coli die-off was also negligible. Consequently, autochthonous bacteria were identified as the predominant biotic stress to the die-off of E. coli in beach sand. Subsequent experiments demonstrated that the beach sand had a very low protozoan concentration and low protozoan growth potential when compared with various environmental samples. Co-culturing of E. coli with autochthonous sand bacterial isolates significantly enhanced E. coli die-off. PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis analysis revealed a complex sand bacterial community, suggesting that bacterial antagonistic effects may be widespread. The study also found that E. faecalis exhibited a much longer survival in beach sand compared with E. coli.},

Large agricultural and industrial areas were submerged, as well as towns and villages. However, as regards the Odra lagoon and the beaches of the Isle of Usedom, the substances transported, such as nutrients and pollutants, did not cause much damage, due to strong dilution. Hygienic investigations (human pathogenic bacteria and viruses) showed that the water had bathing quality during the whole flood.},

	annote = {Pathogens present in animal fecal deposits excreted to land undergo a poorly defined process of dispersion, transport or attenuation, and inactivation. The transport of pathogens overland in surface runoff is clearly responsible for event-related increases in the concentrations of in-stream waterborne pathogens in many watersheds. However, there are significant knowledge gaps concerning the precise mechanisms of pathogen transport. This article reviews the fate and transport of pathogens in watersheds supplying drinking water, from their deposition in feces and septic seepages on land to their dispersion in major tributaries. Pathogens considered representative of those associated with waterborne disease included enteric viruses derived from human fecal contamination, bacterial pathogens represented by Escherichia coli 0157:H7, and the protozoan pathogens Cryptosporidium and Giardia. References to suitable model and index organisms for these pathogens are described. The key processes determining the fate and transport of pathogens within watersheds are discussed in the context of changing agricultural practices, climate, and scale factors. A generic conceptual model for watershed processes is described in light of the knowledge gaps identified from this review. Future areas for fundamental research were identified and included: (I) inactivation kinetics of pathogens in soil and fecal matrices; (2) characterization of the particle sizes with which pathogens are transported; (3) characterization of pathogen properties and watershed-specific features that affect terrestrial transport and attenuation; and (4) the inactivation and sedimentation of pathogens during their initial introduction to the aquatic environment. Such information is critical to advance the assessment of pathogen total maximum daily loads (TMDL), determining management priorities and appropriate control points, as well as integrating pathogens within the broader watershed hydrologic models.},

	annote = {Aims: To determine the levels and species distribution of enterococci in intertidal and marine sediments and coastal waters at two beaches frequently in violation of bacterial water standards. Methods and Results: Faecal indicator bacteria were extracted from sediment and enumerated using membrane filtration. High levels of enterococci were detected in intertidal sediments in a seasonal river and near a storm drain outlet. Low levels were found in marine sediments at 10 m depths and in surf zone sand. Bacterial isolates presumptively identified as Enterococcus on mEI media were speciated. The predominant species found in both water and sediment included Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus hirae, Enterococcus casseliflavus and Enterococcus mundtii. A number of isolates (11-26{\%}) from regulatory water samples presumptively identified as enterococci on mEI media were subsequently identified as species other than Enterococcus. At both study sites, the distribution of species present in water was comparable with those in sediments and the distribution of species was similar in water samples passing and exceeding bacterial indicator standards. Conclusions: High levels of Enterococcus in intertidal sediments indicate retention and possible regrowth in this environment. Significance and Impact of the Study: Resuspension of enterococci that are persistent in sediments may cause beach water quality failures and calls into question the specificity of this indicator for determining recent faecal contamination. {\copyright}2005 The Society for Applied Microbiology.},

Four groups of protozoa (ciliates, non-dinoflagellate flagellates, dinoflagellates and sarcodines) were analysed for their abundance and diversity, as well as the influence of the measured parameters on the communities. Temperature, pH, and dissolved oxygen were the main factors responsible for seasonal differences. Temperature increased at the beginning of spring and summer, coinciding with growth of the protozoan community. Flagellates and dinoflagellates increased during spring and early summer. The amount of organic matter subsequently rose. The final step of this succession was the development of the ciliate community. A comparison between the same areas in 1989 and in the present study was carried out.},

This paper presents a critical review of source tracking with emphasis on the extent to which methods have been tested (especially in comparison with other methods and/or with blind samples), when methods are applicable, their shortcomings, and their usefulness in predicting public health risk or pathogen occurrence. In addition, the paper discusses the broader question of whether fecal source tracking and fecal indicator monitoring is the best approach to regulate water quality and protect human health. Many fecal source-tracking methods have only been tested against sewage or fecal samples or isolates in laboratory studies (proof of concept testing) and/or applied in field studies where the ``real''answer is not known, so their comparative performance and accuracy cannot be assessed. For source tracking to be quantitative, stability of ratios between host-specific markers in the environment must be established. In addition, research is needed on the correlation between host-specific markers and pathogens, and survival of markers after waste treatments. As a result of the exclusive emphasis on FIB in legislation, monitoring has concentrated on FIB and lost sight of pathogens. A more rational approach to regulating water quality would start with available epidemiological data to identify pathogens of concern in a particular water body, and then use targeted pathogen monitoring coupled with targeted fecal source tracking to control them. Baseline monitoring of indicators would become just one tool among many.},

	annote = {This report focuses on the results of a study of the geohydrology of the geologic section that stratigraphically includes the Patapsco, Magothy, Matawan, Severn, Aquia, and Talbot Formations in east-central Anne Arundel County, Maryland. The principal aquifers within this Coastal Plain sequence of Holocene to Cretaceous sediments are the Aquia, Magothy, and Upper Patapsco. Results of aquifer tests at the Quiet Waters Park test site indicate that the horizontal hydraulic conductivity and the specific storage for the Aquia aquifer are about 4 feet per day and 4×10-6 foot-1, respectively. An average horizontal hydraulic conductivity of about 40 feet per day for the Magothy aquifer was calculated from specific-capacity measurements. The Upper Patapsco aquifer, which is about 200 to 300 feet thick, is equivalent to the uppermost sandunit in the Patapsco Formation. Acidic precipitation that recharges the Aquia aquifer produces pH values as low as 4.4. This low-pH water, which also contains high dissolve-oxygen concentrations, reacts with the glauconitic and goethitic sand and weathered shell material of the Aquia aquifer to produce high dissolved iron and dissolved calcium and magnesium concentrations. The result is a calcium and magnesium bicarbonate-type water. The Magothy and Upper Patapsco aquifers lack significant quantities of shell material and, in contrast to the Aquia aquifer, contain an acidic iron sulfate-type water. Brackish water that underlies freshwater within the Aquia and Monmouth aquifers wedges 200 to 500 feet inland along the shores of Annapolis Neck and the Mayo Peninsula. Four of eight test wells located along the shore and screened in the Aquia and Monmouth aquifers had chloride concentrations exceeding 5900 milligrams per liter, indicating the presence of the brackish-water wedge. The nearshore brackish-water/freshwater interface is relatively sharp and steeply inclined; however, elevated chloride concentrations may indicate sources other than brackish-water intrusion. Three criteria were used to differentiate sources of elevated chloride concentrations: 1) the bromide:chloride ratio, 2) nitrogen concentrations, and 3) the theoretical location of the Ghyben-Herzberg interface. The water chemistry of the brackish-water wedge is affected by: 1) a chemically reducing, anoxic environment below the bottom of the Chesapeake Bay, 2) brackish-water dilution, and 3) cation exchange. These processes produce concentrations of iron and manganese as high as 240 000 and 2500 micrograms per liter, respectively; increase concentrations of calcium, magnesium, sodium, potassium, and sulfate; and produce higher than predicted concentrations of calcium due to cation exchange with sodium. A quasi-three-dimensional ground-water-flow model simulated hydraulic head changes for the transient time period 1900-90. The model, which simulated the water-table and the Aquia, Monmouth, Magothy, and Upper Patapsco aquifers, was calibrated by matching hydrographs of 176 observation wells with simulated water levels. Analyses of rates of ground-water flow indicated that water that recharges of 176 observation wells with simulated water levels. Analyses of rates of ground-water flow indicated that water that recharges the Magothy aquifer where the aquifer crops out under Round Bay requires about 300 to 1700 years to travel to the point that recharges in the Upper Patapsco aquifer at the Arnold well field. A two-dimensional solute-transport model for the Quiet Water Park test site on Annapolis Neck simulated hydraulic heads and dissolved-solids concentrations as measured in 1990. Simulated equilibrium with respect to the 1990 conditions was approached after 600 years. Simulation results indicate that a small difference in well-screen depth with respect to the interface of the brackish-water wedge makes a substantial difference in the freshwater life of a well.

The reanalysis used logistic regression modeling to estimate the probability of gastroenteritis occurring in the individual swimmer at different enterococci densities. The results of this reanalysis show that the mathematical relationship between enterococci density and swimming-associated gastroenteritis derived by the EPA study to be of questionable validity.

Until recently, the coliform group of bacteria has been the most widely used indicator organism. Recent epidemiological studies have suggested that other indicator organisms might be more appropriate than the coliform organism in routine water quality surveys. Regardless of which indicator organism is used, there are 2 methods of enumeration common to all indicator organisms: the Multiple Tube Fermentation Technique and the Membrane Filtration Technique. Each technique yields imprecise estimates of indicator organism density. Unless particular attention is paid to this lack of precision, data generated in routine water quality surveys can be inadequate, and even misleading.

Recently, the use of these indicators to regulate recreational water bodies, particularly in sub/tropical recreational marine waters without known sources of sewage, has been questioned. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the risk to humans from exposure to subtropical recreational marine waters with no known point source, and the possible relationship between microbe densities and reported symptoms in human subjects with random-exposure assignment and intensive individual microbial monitoring in this environment. Methods A total of 1303 adult regular bathers were randomly assigned to bather and non-bather groups, with subsequent follow-up for reported illness, in conjunction with extensive environmental sampling of indicator organisms (enterococci). Results Bathers were 1.76 times more likely to report gastrointestinal illness [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.94--3.30; P = 0.07]; 4.46 times more likely to report acute febrile respiratory illness (95% CI 0.99--20.90; P = 0.051) and 5.91 times more likely to report a skin illness (95% CI 2.76--12.63; P < 0.0001) relative to non-bathers. Evidence of a dose--response relationship was found between skin illnesses and increasing enterococci exposure among bathers [1.46 times (95% CI 0.97--2.21; P = 0.07) per increasing log10 unit of enterococci exposure], but not for gastrointestinal or respiratory illnesses. Conclusions This study indicated that bathers may be at increased risk of several illnesses relative to non-bathers, even in the absence of any known source of domestic sewage impacting the recreational marine waters. There was no dose--response relationship between gastroenteritis and increasing exposure to enterococci, even though many current water-monitoring standards use gastroenteritis as the major outcome illness.},

A database consisting of 2066 parallel fecal streptococci and enterovirus enumerations taken from 416 different marine water locations throughout the United Kingdom was used in the analyses. Polychotomous logistic regression was used to model the probabilities of zero enterovirus, a possible infectious dose and a probable infectious dose of enterovirus being present over increasing fecal streptococci densities. The results of the polychotomous logistic regression analyses showed that the probability of the absence of enterovirus (i.e., zero enteroviruses being present) remained higher than the probability of the presence of either a possible or probable infectious dose in 101 of seawater up to a fecal streptococci density of 1000/100 ml of sample (actual estimated probabilities for the three groupings of enterovirus densities described above, at a fecal streptococci density of 1000 equaled 0.44, 0.44, and 0.12, respectively). In addition, the probability of zero enteroviruses being present remained higher than the probability of one or more enteroviruses being present in 101 of seawater up to a fecal streptococci density of 450/100 ml of sample. Since previously published epidemiological studies have shown an excess risk of gastroenteritis to occur among bathers exposed to as few as 32 fecal streptococci per 100 ml of sample, these results suggest that the actual viruses enumerated by the enterovirus assay are not etiologically related to recreational water-associated gastroenteritis. Since gastroenteritis has been the most consistently reported bathing water associated illness, these findings suggest the enterovirus assay to be of limited use in assessing marine recreational water quality given the increasing tendency to formulate water quality standards based on increased risk of gastroenteritis among bathers relative to non-bathers.},

E. coli genotypes (rep-PCR genomic profiles) and E. coli (Vitek super( registered ) GNI+) and enterococci (API super( registered ) rapid ID 32 Strep and resistance to streptomycin, gentamicin, vancomycin, tetracycline and ampicillin) phenotypes were determined for isolates obtained from gull faeces both early and late in the swimming season. Identical E. coli genotypes were obtained only from single gull faecal samples but most faecal samples yielded more than one genotype (median of eight genotypes for samples with 10 isolates). E. coli isolates from the same site that clustered at greater than or equal to 85{\%} similarity were from the same sampling date and shared phenotypic characteristics, and at this similarity level there was population overlap between the two geographically isolated beach sites. Enterococcus API super( registered ) profiles varied with sampling date. Gull enterococci displayed wide variation in antibiotic resistance patterns, and high-level resistance to some antibiotics. Gull faeces could be a major contributor of E. coli (10 super(5)-10 super(9) CFU g super(-1)) and enterococci (10 super(4)-10 super(8) CFU g super(-1)) to Great Lakes recreational waters. E. coli and enterococci in gull faeces are highly variable with respect to their genotypic and phenotypic characteristics and may exhibit temporal or geographic trends in these features. The high degree of variation in genotypic or phenotypic characteristics of E. coli or enterococci populations within gull hosts will require extensive sampling for adequate characterization, and will influence methods that use these characteristics to determine faecal contamination sources for recreational waters.},

In addition, water samples from all sites were tested for indicators of potentially pathogenic E. coli by three assays: a growth-based assay for sorbitol-negative E. coli, an immunological assay for E. coli O157, and a molecular assay for three virulence and two serotype genes. Samples were also collected from two non-urbanized sites outside of Oakland County. Results from the urbanized Oakland County area were compared to those from these two non-urbanized sites. Fecal indicator bacteria concentrations exceeded State of Michigan recreational water-quality standards and (or) recommended U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) standards in samples from all but two Oakland County sites. Multiple-antibiotic-resistant fecal coliform bacteria were found at all sites, including two reference sites from outside the county. Two sites (Stony Creek and Paint Creek) yielded fecal coliform isolates resistant to all tested antibiotics. Patterns indicative of extended-spectrum- -lactamase (ESBL)-producing fecal coliform bacteria were found at eight sites in Oakland County and E. coli resistant to clinically significant antibiotics were recovered from the River Rouge, Clinton River, and Paint Creek. Vancomycin-resistant presumptive enterococci were found at six sites in Oakland County and were not found at the reference sites. Evidence of acquired antibiotic resistances was detected in bacteria from multiple sites in Oakland County but not detected in bacteria from the reference sites. Integrons capable of transferring resistance were detected in isolates from the River Rouge and Clinton River. E. faecium and identified in samples collected from Kearsley Creek and Evans Ditch were resistant to high levels of vancomycin and carried transferable genes responsible for resistance. Several sites in Oakland County had indicators of pathogenic E. coli in August and (or) September 2003. Two samples from the Clinton River in August tested positive for all three E. coli O157 tests. Both the August and September samples from one River Rouge site were positive for the immunological and molecular assay for E. coli O157. A combination of virulence genes commonly associated with human illness was detected at five sites in August and seven sites in September. Antibiotic-resistance profiles of clinical concern along with genes capable of transferring the resistance were found at several sites throughout Oakland County; samples from many of these sites also contained potentially pathogenic E. coli.},

This study was done to aid in the determination of safe recreational use and to help water-resource managers assess more quickly and accurately the degradation of recreational water quality. Water and lake-bottom sediments were collected and ancillary environmental data were compiled for 41 days from May through September 1997. Turbidity, antecedent rainfall, volumes of wastewater-treatment plant overflows and metered outfalls, a resuspension index, and wave heights were found to be statistically related to E. coli concentrations; however, wind speed, wind direction, water temperature, and the presence of swimmers were shown to be statistically unrelated. Multiple linear regression (MLR) was used to develop a model to predict E. coli concentrations, and thus the recreational water quality, at the three beaches. The chosen MLR model used weighted categorical rainfall, turbidity, and wave height to predict E. coli concentrations. This model accounted for 58 percent of the variability in E. coli concentrations and for 1997, predicted the recreational water quality as well as, and in some cases better than the current method.},

Concentrations of E. coli were determined in water and lake-bottom sediments collected during a variety of environmental conditions--during dry, calm weather; before, during and after rainfall; for various increased wave heights; and before and after heavy recreational use. The concentrations of E. coli in water and lake-bottom sediments were plotted as a function of time along with wave heights, occurrence of wastewater-treatment plant overflows, and rainfall amounts. These plots were examined qualitatively to determine if these factors affected E. coli concentrations in water and sediment. This report provides water-resource managers with information on the water-quality and environmental factors that affect fecal-indicator concentrations at three Lake Erie beaches. It also provides evidence that predictive models may be developed to help water-resource managers more quickly and accurately assess the degradation of recreational water quality to protect the public health.}

	annote = {The need for rapid assessments of recreational water quality to better protect public health is well accepted throughout the research and regulatory communities. Rapid analytical methods, such as quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and immunomagnetic separation/adenosine triphosphate (ATP) analysis, are being tested but are not yet ready for widespread use. Another solution is the use of predictive models, wherein variable(s) that are easily and quickly measured are surrogates for concentrations of fecal-indicator bacteria. Rainfall-based alerts, the simplest type of model, have been used by several communities for a number of years. Deterministic models use mathematical representations of the processes that affect bacteria concentrations; this type of model is being used for beach-closure decisions at one location in the USA. Multivariable statistical models are being developed and tested in many areas of the USA; however, they are only used in three areas of the Great Lakes to aid in notifications of beach advisories or closings. These ``operational''statistical models can result in more accurate assessments of recreational water quality than use of the previous day's Escherichia coli (E. coli) concentration as determined by traditional culture methods. The Ohio Nowcast, at Huntington Beach, Bay Village, Ohio, is described in this paper as an example of an operational statistical model. Because predictive modeling is a dynamic process, water-resource managers continue to collect additional data to improve the predictive ability of the nowcast and expand the nowcast to other Ohio beaches and a recreational river. Although predictive models have been shown to work well at some beaches and are becoming more widely accepted, implementation in many areas is limited by funding, lack of coordinated technical leadership, and lack of supporting epidemiological data.},

	annote = { The Ohio Nowcast has been providing real-time beach advisories to the public on the basis of predictive models since 2006. In support of the nowcast, data were collected during the recreational season of 2008 to validate and refine predictive models at two Lake Erie beaches. Predictive models yield data on the probability that the single-sample bathing-water standard for E. coli will be exceeded. Field personnel collected or compiled data on Escherichia coli (E. coli) concentrations as well as variables expected to affect these concentrations, including manual and automated measurements of turbidity, wave height, and water temperature; lake level; and radar and airport rainfall amounts. Two new variables were measured during 2008---photosynthetically-active radiation at Huntington (Bay Village) and foreshore head at Edgewater (Cleveland).(The foreshore is a strip of land along a body of water between low and high water marks.) The performance of the nowcast was monitored during 2008. The Huntington nowcast yielded a greater percentage of correct responses (84.9 percent) than did the previous day's E. coli concentration (75.2 percent). In contrast, at Edgewater, the nowcast yielded a slightly higher percentage of correct responses (61.0 percent) as compared to the previous day's E. coli concentration (56.5 percent), but both percentages were relatively low. Lake levels in 2008 were significantly higher than levels in the data used to develop the Edgewater models (2004−7), confounding their abilities to provide correct responses. At Edgewater during 2008, the strongest relation (as measured by Pearson's correlation) was between E. coli concentrations and the difference in foreshore head over the past 24 hours (r=0.48), a variable not included in the models. At Huntington, photosynthetically-active radiation on the previous day showed a significant negative relation to E. coli concentrations (r=-0.33) during 2008. Refined models were developed for Huntington and Edgewater using data collected from 2005−8. The refined models included the variables wave height, log turbidity, radar or airport rainfall, and day of the year in various combinations for different dated segments of the recreational season. Water-resource managers will determine which models to apply to the Ohio Nowcast for issuing water-quality advisories in 2009.},

	annote = {Source-tracking tools were used to identify potential sources of fecal contamination at two Lake Erie bathing beaches: an urban beach (Edgewater in Cleveland, Ohio) and a beach in a small city (Lakeshore in Ashtabula, Ohio). These tools included identifying spatial patterns of Escherichia coli (E. coli) concentrations in each area, determining weather patterns that caused elevated E. coli, and applying microbial source tracking (MST) techniques to specific sites. Three MST methods were used during this study: multiple antibiotic resistance (MAR) indexing of E. coli isolates and the presence of human-specific genetic markers within two types of bacteria, the genus Bacteroides and the species Enterococcus faecium. At Edgewater, sampling for E. coli was done during 2003?05 at bathing-area sites, at nearshore lake sites, and in shallow ground water in foreshore and backshore areas. Spatial sampling at nearshore lake sites showed that fecal contamination was most likely of local origin; E. coli concentrations near the mouths of rivers and outfalls remote to the beach were elevated (greater than 235 colony-forming units per 100 milliliters (CFU/100 mL)) but decreased along transport pathways to the beach. In addition, E. coli concentrations were generally highest in bathing-area samples collected at 1- and 2-foot water depths, midrange at 3-foot depths, and lowest in nearshore lake samples typically collected 150 feet from the shoreline. Elevated E. coli concentrations at bathing-area sites were generally associated with increased wave heights and rainfall, but not always. E. coli concentrations were often elevated in shallow ground-water samples, especially in samples collected less than 10 feet from the edge of water (near foreshore area). The interaction of shallow ground water and waves may be a mechanism of E. coli storage and accumulation in foreshore sands. Infiltration of bird feces through sand with surface water from rainfall and high waves may be concentrating E. coli in shallow ground water in foreshore and backshore sands. At Lakeshore, sampling for E. coli was done at bathing-area, nearshore lake, and parking-lot sites during 2004?05. Low concentrations of E. coli at nearshore lake sites furthest from the shoreline indicated that fecal contamination was most likely of local origin. High concentrations of E. coli in water and bed sediments at several nearshore lake sites showed that contamination was emanating from several points along the shoreline during wet and dry weather, including the boat ramp, an area near the pond drainage, and parking-lot sediments. Physical evidence confirmed that runoff from the parking lot leads to degradation of water quality at the beach. MST samples were collected to help interpret spatial findings and determine whether sources of fecal contamination were from wastewater or bird feces and if a human-specific marker was present. MAR indices were useful in distinguishing between bird feces and wastewater sources because they were about 10 times higher in the latter. The results from MAR indices agreed with results from the two human-specific markers in some but not all of the samples tested. Bacteroides and enterococci human-specific markers were found on one day at Edgewater and two days at Lakeshore. On three days at Edgewater and two days at Lakeshore, the MAR index indicated a mixed source, but neither marker was found in bathing-water samples; this may be because bacterial indicator concentrations were too low to detect a marker. Multiple tools are needed to help identify sources of fecal contamination at coastal beaches. Spatial sampling identified patterns in E. coli concentrations and yielded information on the physical pathways of contamination. MST methods provided information on whether the source was likely of human or nonhuman origin only; however, MST did not provide information on the pathways of contamination. },

	annote = {A study of small public ground-water-supply wells that produce water from discontinuous sand and gravel aquifers was done from July 1999 through July 2001 in southeastern Michigan. Samples were collected to determine the occurrence of viral pathogens and microbiological indicators of fecal contamination ({\$}indicators{\$}), determine whether indicators are adequate predictors of the presence of enteric viruses, and determine the factors that affect the presence of enteric viruses. Small systems are those that serve less than 3,300 people. Samples were analyzed for specific enteric viruses by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), for culturable viruses by cell culture, and for the indicators total coliforms, Escherichia coli (E. coli), enterococci, and F-specific and somatic coliphage. Ancillary environmental and water-quality data were collected or compiled. A total of 169 regular samples and 32 replicate pairs were collected from 38 wells. Replicate pairs were samples collected at the same well on the same date. One well was sampled 6 times, 30 wells were sampled five times, 6 wells were sampled twice, and 1 well was sampled once. By use of RT-PCR, enterovirus was found in four wells (10.5 percent) and hepatitis A virus (HAV) in five wells (13.2 percent). In two of these wells, investigators found both enterovirus and HAV, but on different sampling dates. Culturable viruses were found one time in two wells (5.9 percent), and neither of these wells was positive for viruses by use of RT-PCR on any sampling date. If results for all viruses are combined, 9 of the 38 small public-supply wells were positive for enteric viruses (23.7 percent) by either cell culture or RT-PCR. One or more indicators were found in 18 of 38 wells. Total coliforms, E. coli, enterococci, and F-specific and somatic coliphage were found in 34.2, 10.5, 15.8, 5.9, and 5.9 percent, respectively, of the wells tested. In only 3 out of 18 wells were samples positive for an indicator on more than one date at the same well. The co-occurrence of enteric viruses and any indicator was 55.6 percent; five out of the nine virus-positive wells were also found to be positive for an indicator. Two wells with detections of viruses had a detection of total coliforms, one well had a detection of E. coli, one of enterococci, and one of F-specific coliphage. On a per sample basis, of 11 samples that were positive for enteric viruses, indicator bacteria co-occurred in only 2 samples, and coliphage were not present in any. More virus-positive samples were found at sites served by septic systems than those served by sewerlines. Sampling condition (ground water or a mixture of tank and ground water), distance to septic system, type of and distance to nearest surface-water body, well characteristics, or land use were not related to the presence of viruses or indicators. Among continuous water-quality variables, statistically significant relations were found between total coliforms and dissolved organic carbon and between total coliforms and iron. There was a statistically significant relation between chloride concentrations >20 mg/L and detections of total coliforms. Presence of nitrate and nitrite was related to the presence of other indicators (E. coli, enterococci, and F-specific and somatic coliphage) or enteric viruses, but not to total coliforms. The data indicated that chloride-to-bromide (C1:Br) ratios may be useful as a screening tool for total coliforms and enteric viruses but not for E. coli, enterococci, and F-specific and somatic coliphage. This study provides evidence for fecal contamination of ground water from small public-supply wells, at least on an intermittent basis. Collecting data on multiple lines of evidence would be needed to reliably predict the presence of enteric viruses and protect public health. Future data collection toward this end could include repeat sampling several times a year for different indicators, measuring dissolved-organic carbon, nitrate plus nitrite, and (or) chloride concentrations, or determining C1:Br ratios. The presence of a site served by a septic system is an indication that the well may be more vulnerable to contamination than a site served by a sewerline. },

In contrast, at Villa Angela during 2007, the model provided correct responses only 61.3 percent of the days monitored. The data from 2007 were added to existing datasets and the larger datasets were split into two (Huntington) or three (Edgewater) segments by date based on the occurrence of false negatives and positives (named ``season 1, season 2, season 3''). Models were developed for dated segments and for combined datasets. At Huntington, the summed responses for separate best models for seasons 1 and 2 provided a greater percentage of correct responses (85.6 percent) than the one combined best model (83.1 percent).

The best model for each beach was based on a unique combination of environmental and water-quality explanatory variables including turbidity, rainfall, wave height, water temperature, day of the year, wind direction, and lake level. Two types of outputs were produced from the models-the predicted Escherichia coli concentration and the probability that the bathing-water standard will be exceeded. The model for one of beaches, Huntington Reservation (Huntington), was validated in 2005. For 2005, the Huntington model yielded more correct responses and better predicted exceedance of the standard than did current methods for assessing recreational water quality, which are based on the previous day's E. coli concentration. Predictions based on the Huntington model have been available to the public through an Internet-based "nowcasting" system since May 30, 2006. The other beach models are being validated for the first time in 2006. The methods used in this study to develop and test predictive models can be applied at other similar coastal beaches.},

@techreport{Francy:2003ch,
	annote = {Results of studies during the recreational seasons of 2000 and 2001 strengthen the science that supports monitoring of our Nation's beaches. Water and sediment samples were collected and analyzed for concentrations of Escherichia coli (E. coli). Ancillary water-quality and environmental data were collected or compiled to determine their relation to E. coli concentrations. Data were collected at three Lake Erie urban beaches (Edgewater, Villa Angela, and Huntington), two Lake Erie beaches in a less populated area (Mentor Headlands and Fairport Harbor), and one inland-lake beach (Mosquito Lake). The distribution of E. coli in water and sediments within the bathing area, outside the bathing area, and near the swash zone was investigated at the three Lake Erie urban beaches and at Mosquito Lake. (The swash zone is the zone that is alternately covered and exposed by waves.) Lake-bottom sediments from outside the bathing area were not significant deposition areas for E. coli. In contrast, interstitial water and subsurface sediments from near the swash zone were enriched with E. coli. For example, E. coli concentrations were as high as 100,000 colonies per 100 milliliters in some interstitial waters. Although there are no standards for E. coli in swash-zone materials, the high concentrations found at some locations warrant concern for public health. Studies were done at Mosquito Lake to identify sources of fecal contamination to the lake and bathing beach. Escherichia coli concentrations decreased with distance from a suspected source of fecal contamination that is north of the beach but increased at the bathing beach. This evidence indicated that elevated E. coli concentrations at the bathing beach are of local origin rather than from transport of bacteria from sites to the north. Samples collected from the three Lake Erie urban beaches and Mosquito Lake were analyzed to determine whether wastewater indicators could be used as surrogates for E. coli at bathing beaches. None of the concentrations of wastewater indicators of fecal contamination, including 3b-coprostanol and cholesterol, were significantly correlated (a=0.05) to concentrations of E. coli. Concentrations of the two compounds that were significantly correlated to E. coli were components of coal tar and asphalt, which are not necessarily indicative of fecal contamination. Data were collected to build on an earlier 1997 study to develop and test multiple-linear-regression models to predict E. coli concentrations using water-quality and environmental variables as explanatory variables. The probability of exceeding the single-sample bathing-water standard for E. coli (235 colonies per 100 milliliters) was used as the model output variable. Threshold probabilities for each model were established. Computed probabilities that are less than a threshold probability indicate that bacterial water quality is most likely acceptable. Computed probabilities equal to or above the threshold probability indicate that the water quality is most likely not acceptable and that a water-quality advisory may be needed. Models were developed at each beach, whenever possible, using combinations of 1997, 2000, and (or) 2001 data. The models developed and tested in this study were shown to be beach specific; that is, different explanatory variables were used to predict the probability of exceeding the standard at each beach. At Mentor Headlands and Fairport Harbor, models were not developed because water quality was generally good. At the three Lake Erie urban beaches, models were developed with variable lists that included the number of birds on the beach at the time of sampling, lake-current direction, wave height, turbidity, streamflow of a nearby river, and rainfall. The models for Huntington explained a larger percentage of the variability in E. coli concentrations than the models for Edgewater and Villa Angela. At Mosquito Lake, a model based on 2000 and 2001 data contained the explanatory variables rainfall, number of dry days preceding a rainfall, date, wind direction, wind speed, and turbidity. Additional research could include testing the threshold probabilities assigned for these models in subsequent years and comparing the models' ability to predict recreational water quality to results from the current method---using antecedent E. coli concentrations. Each year the model is tested, new data can be added and model variables can be recalculated to determine whether the predictive ability improves with additional data.},

Determining the spatial distribution of E. coli and identifying factors that can affect concentrations may provide insight into the sources of fecal contamination. This approach was used to investigate a popular bathing beach in northwest Ohio---Maumee Bay State Park (MBSP). In 2003 synoptic studies, water and bed-sediment samples were collected and analyzed for E. coli at 24 sites within Maumee Bay, a nearby shipping channel, a major tributary to the bay (Maumee River), and nearshore areas at the mouths of drainage ditches. In 2004, samples were collected at 22 sites identified as "hot spots" of fecal contamination during 2003. Daily samples for E. coli were collected at MBSP as part of the Ohio Bathing Beach Monitoring Program. Highest E. coli concentrations were found at sites in the Maumee River, the shipping channel, and in or at the mouth of some drainage ditches. These high values were found in bed sediments underlying the deepest waters, which may act as an E. coli sink. Low E. coli concentrations at sites remote to MBSP indicated that sources from these areas were not important contributors of E. coli. Temperature changes in discharge from a local powerplant did not cause an increase in E. coli concentrations. A ditch that discharges 75 m east of the bathing beach was shown to be a principal source of E. coli. Turbidity and rainfall were positively correlated with E. coli concentrations at MBSP. Higher wave heights and wind directions from the north, northeast, or northwest were associated with higher E. coli concentrations.},

	annote = {Beaches in the United States of (North) America are subject to closure when bacterial counts exceed water quality criteria. Many authorities base these decisions on water samples that typically require at least 18 hours to analyze. This persistence approach, or model, often leads to erroneous decisions due to the great variability in bacterial concentrations. Beaches are closed when they could be open and vice versa, their true status unknown until the next day. Studies show that mathematical models based on multi-variable linear regression (MLR) principles can produce better estimates, or nowcasts, using real-time explanatory variables, such as turbidity, cloud cover, and rainfall. To make such models generally available, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is developing a program called Virtual Beach (VB). VB is public-domain software for developing site-specific predictive models. It features capabilities that make it possible with reasonable effort to develop, and compare the performance of, static and dynamic MLR models. The results of tests on 2006 Huntington Beach, Lake Erie beach data are presented. In addition to nowcasting, the work begins to address the question, can weather and water forecasts be used to forecast beach conditions in advance? A preliminary affirmative answer is provided based on an analysis of the Huntington Beach data, with weather forecasts for nearby Cleveland-Hopkins international airport, and NOAA lake condition forecasts. We encourage those engaged in beach monitoring and management to request VB, applying the nowcast and forecast models developed with it to their locations of interest.

	annote = {Public concern over microbial contamination of recreational waters has increased in recent years. A common approach to evaluating beach water quality has been to use the persistence model which assumes that day-old monitoring results provide accurate estimates of current concentrations. This model is frequently incorrect Recent studies have shown that statistical regression models based on least-squares fitting often are more accurate. To make such models more generally available, the Virtual Beach (VB) tool was developed. VB is public-domain software that prescribes site-specific predictive models. In this study we used VB as a tool to evaluate statistical modeling for predicting Escherichia coli (E. coli) levels at Huntington Beach, on Lake Erie. The models were based on readily available weather and environmental data, plus U.S. Geological Service onsite data. Although models for Great Lakes beaches have frequently been fitted to multiyear data sets, this work demonstrates that useful statistical models can be based on limited data sets collected over much shorter time periods, leading to dynamic models that are periodically refitted as new data become available. Comparisons of the resulting nowcasts (predictions of current, but yet unknown, bacterial levels) with observations verified the effectiveness of VB and showed that dynamic models are about as accurate as long-term static models. Finally, fitting models to forecasted explanatory variables, bacteria forecasts were found to compare favorably to nowcasts, yielding adjusted coefficients of determination (adjusted R2) of about 0.40. {\copyright}2008 American Chemical Society.},

However, a recent lawsuit alleged one such screening method was inadequate to show bacterial water quality standards would be protected shoreward of Honolulu's Honouliuli outfall. In response, a progressive vector diagram (PVD) and initial dilution plume model were combined to better estimate the frequency of pathogenic bacteria reaching beaches. For each period in a representative current meter data record a vector summation process was applied until the distance to a sensitive site was reached. Corresponding travel times were noted. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) PLUMES UM model and farfield algorithm were used to estimate dilutions. Sometimes dilution alone reduces concentrations below the state standard. Most importantly, however, the analysis shows an order of magnitude reduction in frequency of incidence at the site of concern compared to the simple current rose screening method. The PVD method also better estimates travel times, showing that exposure to bacteriologically lethal sunlight is common. The approach and subsequent independent work support the existing permit.},

	annote = { Aims: Methods for the detection of coliforms in water have changed significantly in recent years with procedures incorporating substrates for the detection of β-d-galactosidase becoming more widely used. This study was undertaken to determine the range of coliform genera detected with methods that rely on lactose fermentation and compare them to those recovered using methods based upon β-d-galactosidase. Methods and Results: Coliform isolates were recovered from sewage-polluted water using m-endo, membrane lauryl sulfate broth, tergitol TTC agar, Colilert-18{\textregistered}, ChromoCult{\textregistered} and ColiScan{\textregistered} for primary isolation. Organisms were grouped according to whether they had been isolated based upon lactose fermentation or β-d-galactosidase production. Conclusions: A wide range of coliform genera were detected using both types of methods. There was considerable overlap between the two groups, and whilst differences were seen between the genera isolated with the two method types, no clear pattern emerged. Substantial numbers of `new' coliforms (e.g. Raoutella spp.) were recovered using both types of methods. Significance and Impact of the Study: The results presented here confirm that both methods based on lactose fermentation or detection of β-d-galactosidase activity recover a range of coliform organisms. Any suggestion that only methods which are based upon fermentation of lactose recover organisms of public health or regulatory significance cannot be substantiated. Furthermore, the higher recovery of coliform organisms from sewage-polluted water using methods utilizing β-d-galactosidase-based methods does not appear to be because of the recovery of substantially more `new' coliforms.},

Reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) can be effectively used for genotyping if specific primer sets are designed to be capable of identifying all members within each genogroup. In this study genogroup-specific primer sets were designed using a minimum of 5 to a maximum of 10 complete phage genome sequences from strains in each genogroup. With these primers and employing a heat-release procedure that eliminated the need for RNA purification an RT-PCR method for genotype identification of FRNA phages was developed. The four genogroup-specific primer sets generated discrete PCR amplicon sizes from a variety of environmental FRNA phage strains. Limits of detection, cross-reactivity and/or non-specific binding to strains from other genogroups were evaluated.},

	annote = {PURPOSE: Cryptosporidium oocysts are commonly detected in surface-derived drinking water, however, the public health significance of these findings is unclear. This study compared the evidence of prior Cryptosporidium infection for people drinking water derived from surface versus ground water sources. METHODS: This study measured serological responses to two Cryptosporidium antigen groups for blood donors from two midwestern United States cities with different drinking water sources: filtered and chlorinated river water receiving agricultural and domestic sewage upstream versus chlorinated water from an underground aquifer. Initial and nine-month paired serological responses to two Cryptosporidium antigen groups were compared. RESULTS: Initially, donors from the surface water city had a higher relative prevalence (RP) of a serological response (54% vs 38%, RP = 1.39 (1.21,1.60)). Donors with a detectable baseline response who resided in the surface water city had a higher relative risk (RR) of an increased intensity of response on the follow-up blood draw (15/17-kDa, 40/100 vs 11/100, RR = 3.78 (1.89,7.58)), (27-kDa 38/100 vs 18/100, RR = 2.07 (1.31,3.25)). Donors with no baseline response to the 15/17-kDa marker who resided in the surface water city also had a higher risk of serconversion (38/100 vs 14/100, RR = 2.63 (1.78,3.91)). CONCLUSIONS: These rates of both background and drinking water related Cryptosporidium infections are substantially higher than previously estimated, however, the risk of illness from infection may be lower.},

The source of these fecal indicator bacteria has been determined to be the soil where these bacteria are able to multiply and have become part of the soil microflora. The mechanisms by which these fecal bacteria are able to multiply under ambient soil conditions have not been determined. The objective of this study was to test two hypotheses by which these fecal bacteria can establish populations in the soil environment. The first hypothesis states that the soil environment is restrictive for the growth of fecal bacteria but a sub-population of fecal bacteria with metabolic characteristics adaptable to growth in soil will be selected to establish a population. The second hypothesis states that the soil environment is permissive and most strains of fecal bacteria will be able to multiply and become part of the soil microflora. The metabolic profile of soil isolates of 48 E. coli and 30 enterococci were determined based on their ability to metabolize 95 different carbon sources using the Biolog System. These results showed that many metabolically diverse strains of E. coli as well as six different species of Enterococcus were recovered from seven different groups of soil in Hawaii. These results support the hypothesis that soil conditions in Hawaii are permissive for the growth of most strains of fecal bacteria. Thus, the genetic capabilities of fecal bacteria are sufficiently robust to overcome all of the ecological constraints in the soil environment and have succeeded in becoming a minor but significant fraction of the soil microflora.},

USEPA assumes that the sources of these fecal bacteria are feces of human/animals or sewage. Moreover, that there are no environmental sources of these fecal indicator bacteria. If these assumptions are not valid, the application of these fecal indicator bacteria to assess the quality of water is of questionable value. We have determined that unlike the continental USA which is located in the temperate region of the world, tropical island environments (streams, soil) such as Hawaii and Guam contain high concentrations of fecal indicator bacteria in the absence of fecal or sewage contamination. Thus, in Hawaii, the presence of high concentrations of fecal indicator bacteria in streams does not necessarily indicate that the water is contaminated with feces. We have recently documented that these fecal indicator bacteria can be recovered from all of the seven major soil types in Oahu and appear to be multiplying in the soil environment. Thus, these fecal indicator bacteria can be transported from the soil to streams, stormdrains and coastal waters by runoff from rain, as well as from urban and agricultural uses of water. C. perfringens, an alternative fecal indicator, cannot multiply in the environment and is a better indicator to establish water quality standards in Hawaii. In summary, due to inherent differences in the environment between tropical island conditions and temperate continental conditions, water quality standards specific for that environment should be used.},

Marine water samples from Hanauma Bay, Oahu, were characterized by low concentrations of fecal coliforms and Clostridium perfringens but unusually high concentrations of presumptive FS when KF agar was used. Most of the presumptive FS colonies on KF agar could not be verified and was therefore concluded to be 'false positive'. At least two types of catalase-positive bacteria were determined to be responsible for the formation of false-positive colonies on KF agar: one, a gram-positive coccus; the other, a gram-negative, NaCl-requiring bacillus.

These two tests were used to analyze water samples from marine swimming beaches, streams, nonswimming coastal waters and raw sewage. The major advantages of the FDT test include formation of anaerobic conditions without the need of anaerobic chamber systems and enumeration of colonies of C. perfringens in the tubes within 6 h. The results showed that 5 mL of water sample and 20 mL of 2×Shahidi Ferguson Perfringens medium were the best combination for the enumeration of C. perfringens in 5-6 h at 42C. This is a candidate, rapid beach monitoring method which can be used to close the beach on the same day the water samples were collected. The major advantages of the EasyPhage method include the rapid formation of gel without the use of heat, and addition of streptomycin and ampicillin to control interfering bacterial contamination. These two test methods allow most water laboratories to monitor environmental waters for C. perfringens and F-specific RNA coliphages as indicators of fecal contamination. {\copyright}2007, Blackwell Publishing.},

In that respect, the implementation of its action plans - right from its creation - has made it possible to maintain and restore the usage quality levels that meet national and European standards. The Loire Bretagne Agency, which manages the longest coastline of all local authorities in France, serves a twofold objective: to improve the sanitary quality of the bathing and conchyliculture water on the one hand, and to fight against the proliferation of phytoplanctons - toxic or non toxic - and macro green algae along the coastline of Brittany on the other hand. Indeed, due to its natural characteristics and to intensive farming, Brittany is severely affected by "green tides". Within the framework of the 5th and 6th programmes, major efforts were devoted to the construction of collection and purification works and facilities for the coastal local authorities - especially the municipalities - the main objective thereof being the restoration of the sanitary quality of the beaches. This policy has been supported by means of reduced rate financial aid to compensate for increased fees. During this period, the Agency carried out studies intended to gain a better knowledge and understanding of the dynamics and phenomena of the environment. Within the framework of the 7th programme, the Agency reinforces its sanitary quality improvement policy for bathing water and extends it to conchyliculture; moreover it proposes aids with a 20{\%} increase in that direction. It also develops a policy against pollution based on geographical zones, especially to minimize the proliferation of green algae. Preferential financings are elaborated in colloboration with the Bretagne Regional Authority for pilot catchment basins. Agricultural pollution control is one of Brittany most urgent challenge. This fight is supported by the fact that this region has just been classified as a vulnerable zone within the framework of the European Directive on nitrates and through the implementation of various regional programmes. Continuous efforts are in progress in order to improve the knowledge of the environment and of the phenomena that affect it, particularly the toxic micro algae. Finally, a very dynamic concerted political approach (SAGE - bay contract : restoration-preservation contract), is implemented to manage the coastline under the authority of the Agency.},

	annote = {A summary is given on ecological and hygienic problems of coastal waters, beginning with an outline of the different standpoints in ecology and hygiene. Because of close interrelationships between these fields, the hygienist is introduced to the ecological problems of the Baltic Sea. Hygienic questions have drawn attention because of the so-called Baltic Sea disease (Red tides? - Indication of virus contamination by bacterial indicators of faeces?). On the basis of the results of a two-year authoritative study of the German Baltic Sea coast, a discussion is presented on 1) the relationship between the coli titer and the frequency of salmonella detection, 2) the necessity of routine tests for salmonella, 3) aims of bacteriological cleanliness, 4) the importance of chemical parameters for evaluation, and 5) necessary measures for prevention of pollution of the water and beaches of the Baltic Sea. Emphasis is placed on the fact that for ecological reasons the third stage of sewage purification has attained increased significance. The paper refers repeatedly to international agreements (Baltic Sea Convention of 1974, the 1975 WHO report on the recreational quality of beaches and coastal waters, European Community guidelines of 1975) and their relations to the presented findings and considerations.},

Two existing outfalls are too close to the shore or low water mark and the sea is consequently polluted at these discharge points. The local water authority proposes an underground sewage works for screening and degritting, before the sewage discharges out to sea at a minimum depth of 15 m through a new 1450 m outfall. A local swimming group has continued to voice opposition to this proposal and has suggested an alternative plan, using evidence from other sea outfalls in the U.K. Their complaint concerning the proposed scheme is that the sewage will be washed back to the beaches due to local currents and tides. The water authority is convinced that dilution, salt and wave motion will dispel and kill any bacteria at the discharge point. (A.J.)},

To make this characterization, two indicators of faecal contamination have been selected: faecal coliforms (FC) and Clostridium perfringens (CP). The results show that low concentrations of FC and CP in water not necessarily implies that their concentration in sediment and elutriates has to be low as well. The highest concentrations were found in locations close to the mouth of rivers, and in beaches of low energy and hence low water renewal, and high accumulation of fine sediments. The concentrations of FC were lower than those obtained for CP in most of the sampling locations. Although quality standards for bathing waters do not take the parameter CP into account, it has been demonstrated that it should be a good indicator of faecal contamination. {\copyright}2007 Elsevier GmbH.

LMX and CC are two media designed to concurrently detect total coliform (TC) bacteria and E. coli by the specific action of beta -galactosidase (total coliforms) and beta -glucuronidase (E. coli). Overall results for the TC test showed that LMX, CC and MTF recovered 2.63, 1.95 and 1.90 times as many TCs as CC-CFS, respectively. Data from the multiple range test showed significant differences (P < 0.05) between TC counts on CC-CFS and LMX. The traditional MTF was less sensitive for E. coli enumeration. However, there was no statistically significant differences between LMX, CC, CC-CFS and the MTF method for E. coli enumeration. Background interference was reduced on CC-CFS and the counts obtained reflected more accurately the number of TCs. Therefore, the contribution of beta -galactosidase positive, non coliform bacteria (Aeromonas spp. and Vibrio spp.) to TC counts should not be neglected.},

	annote = {Criteria for water quality must be based on parameters that relate primarily to health hazards. Other considerations may include parameters that relate to aesthetic enjoyment of the beach area, fishing and shellfish culture. Coastal waters receiving discharges of sewage, stormwater and other animal wastes may contain disease causing bacteria, viruses, and multicellular parasites. Unfortunately, there is no single test that will adequately detect and quantitate the wide spectrum of pathogens that might be present. For this reason, major emphasis has been placed on fecal coliform or fecal coli measurements as evidence of contamination from warm-blooded animal waste discharges. Therefore, it is assumed that the potential for enteric disease increases as fecal coliform desities increase. The development of fecal coliform to fecal streptococcus ratios may be used to identify fecal pollution either as domestic sewage discharges or as nonhuman wastes transported via stormwater runoff. Pseudomonas aeruginosa enumeration may be of importance in warm estuarine environments subject to slow flushing rates and nutrient discharges. Although there is still insufficient specific epidemiological data available to correlate microbiological standards with the general quality of recreational waters, practical limits must be established to prevent further water quality degradation, down-grading of aesthetic quality, and increased public-health risk. The fecal coliform or fecal coli standards used in various countries have been based either on a geometric mean of 200 organisms per 100 ml, or an upper limit of 1,000 organisms per 100 ml, which should never be exceeded or, if reached, reached only with a restricted, specified frequency. Statistical analysis of these two standard approaches indicates that the established limitations are essentially the same. Meaningful application of water-quality standards must be based on the collection of adequate bacteriological data and sanitary-survey intelligence. {\copyright}1974.},

Use of a composite data set composed of ARA and rep-fingerprints, added to the confidence of the identifications. The addition of FAME data to composite data sets did not add to the confidence of identifications. Source identification was performed to better understand risk associated with higher densities of enterococci found in swash zone interstitial water (SZIW) as compared to adjacent bathing water on Pensacola Beach, FL. The "swash zone" is that area of the beach continually washed over by waves. As the potential sources of enterococci were limited in this environment, only two library units, sea gull and human, were constructed. Identification of the beach isolates using a composite data set indicated a sea gull origin. The clonality of the beach isolates suggested that the beach environment selects certain subspecies of E. faecalis.},

An exceptional feature was observed in 1989 when faecal coliforms including Escherichia coli and faecal Streptococcus were less in sand than in sea water. These results may be attributed to the low turbulent activity of the sea in 1989, particularly in summer, compared with the next two years. In 1990 the number of SBP and PPB was always higher in sand than in sea water. The most frequent micro-organisms isolated from sand were E. coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans. Intensive engineering work and the construction of a chlorinator for sewage probably caused a dramatic drop in the number of SBP and PPB in sea water and sand during 1990-1991 on some beaches. Campylobacter jejuni was isolated from sand, and may be considered a possible hazard factor for enteritis in the population bathing at these beaches.},

Aliquots of water are subjected to two-step filtration, with the second filter containing a positively charged nylon membrane that holds back virus particles. Viruses thus adsorbed are directly lysed, and RNA is isolated by hybridization to specific oligonucleotides bound to magnetic beads. The solution used contains guanidine thiocyanate, which lyses virus particles, inactivates enzymes, e.g., RNases, allows mild hybridization conditions, and does not influence biotin-streptavidin interaction on magnetic beads. Detection and specific identification are accomplished by reverse transcription PCR of the highly conserved noncoding region at the 5' end of virus RNA combined with Southern hybridization. The system was tested with tap water artificially spiked with poliovirus vaccine and yielded a detection limit of 20 50{\%} tissue culture infective doses per liter. We used the same procedure to investigate the water quality of surface water at public beaches by rivers and lakes. Of 40 samples tested, 7 were positive for enteroviruses. A comparison with enterobacterial contamination determined by PCR and classical microbiological methods in parallel showed that enteroviruses were found only in samples also positive for Escherichia coli. In conclusion, this procedure can easily be adapted to test large water samples and is simple enough to be used for routine determinations of water quality in terms of virus contamination.},

We use attendance data along with the health cost of gastrointestinal illness to estimate the number of illnesses among swimmers and their likely economic impact. We estimate that between 627,800 and 1,479,200 excess gastrointestinal illnesses occur at beaches in Los Angeles and Orange Counties each year. Using a conservative health cost of gastroenteritis, this corresponds to an annual economic loss of {\$}21 or {\$}51 million depending upon the underlying epidemiological model used (in year 2000 dollars). Results demonstrate that improving coastal water quality could result in a reduction of gastrointestinal illnesses locally and a concurrent savings in expenditures on related health care costs. {\copyright}2006 American Chemical Society.},

	annote = {We have developed a new method based on the sublimation of adenine from Escherichia coli to estimate bacterial cell counts in natural samples. To demonstrate this technique, several types of natural samples, including beach sand, seawater, deep-sea sediment, and two soil samples from the Atacama Desert, were heated to a temperature of 500$\,^{\circ}$C for several seconds under reduced pressure. The sublimate was collected on a cold finger, and the amount of adenine released from the samples was then determined by high-performance liquid chromatography with UV absorbance detection. Based on the total amount of adenine recovered from DNA and RNA in these samples, we estimated bacterial cell counts ranging from ∼105 to 109 E. coli cell equivalents per gram. For most of these samples, the sublimation-based cell counts were in agreement with total bacterial counts obtained by traditional DAPI (4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) staining.},

	annote = {Wisconsin recreational waters are vital to our individual well being and our local and state economies. Lake Michigan and Lake Superior have afforded the state of Wisconsin valuable natural resources for aquatic recreational activities. There are important social and economic benefits to providing safe and healthy aquatic recreational activities to the public. The Beaches Environmental Assessment and Coastal Health (BEACH) Act, passed in October of 2000 requires that States adopt EPA's new criteria for pathogen and pathogen indicators by April 2004. States will be required to use E. coli and/or Enterococci as indicators of pathogens rather than total or fecal coliforms. The BEACH Act also authorizes EPA to provide grants to States that have beaches bordering coastal or Great Lakes recreational waters for the purpose of developing a beach monitoring and public notification program. Water Quality Standards staff has been working with U.S. EPA to secure funding for the development of a comprehensive beach monitoring program. This effort is directed at Great Lakes coastal waters, namely Lake Michigan and Lake Superior. The purpose of this project is to monitor selected beaches along the Great Lakes in accordance with BEACH Act requirements, allow for prompt notification to the public whenever bacterial levels exceeds EPA's established standards, and investigate alternative methods for public notification. This information will be used to investigate long-term trends in water quality and to establish a beach monitoring and public notification plan that will assist communities along the lake shore to improve their ability to monitor and notify beach users of risks associated with high bacteria levels.},

The aim of this work was to determine the abundance and the spatial distribution of total heterotrophic (by flow cytometry) and cultivated bacteria ("pour plate" method on R2A agar). Another objective was to evaluate the lagoon's influence on water quality of Ipanema and Leblon beaches. Physical and chemical data were acquired too. Sub-superficial water samples were taken monthly, from December 1999 to October 2000. On lagoon, the cultivated bacteria abundance varied from 6.9×105 to 5.0×107 CFU.100 mL-1. On Ipanema and Leblon beaches, this parameter yielded 1.4×105 and 2.8×106 CFU.100 mL-1, respectively. Total bacterial abundance varied from 2.9×107 to 3.2×107 cells.mL-1 on lagoon. On Ipanema and Leblon, this parameter yielded 8.7×106 and 1.1×107 cells.mL-1, respectively. Two sub-groups were determined with dominance of HNA cells. Samples were added latter to better understand the bacteria present on these environments. Bacterial abundance were analyzed only by flow cytometry and the results varied from 8.3×106 to 2.5×107 cells.mL-1 on lagoon. On the beach, this parameter yielded 6.9×106 cells. mL-1. Two bacterial subgroups were also observed, with dominance of HNA on lagoon and LNA on the beach. The results showed that the Rodrigo de Freitas Lagoon is an eutrophic ecosystem where the bacterial populations and the physical and chemical parameters do not differ spatially. The data also confirmed that the outflow of the lagoon's polluted waters affect the sanitary conditions of Ipanema and Leblon beaches.},

To investigate this possibility, wet and dry beach sand, beach water, riverine water, canal water, and raw sewage samples were screened by PCR for certain pathogenic microbes and molecular markers of human fecal pollution. The targets included in this study were human specific Bacteroides (HF8 marker), human-specific enterococci (esp gene), Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli 0157:H7, Campylobacter jejuni, and adenovirus. Sewage samples were also tested for Salmonella species. The results were compared to concentrations of enterococci, Escherichia coli, and Bacteroides species, as determined by membrane filtration methods. Molecular analysis yielded positive results for human specific Bacteroides, and S. aureus, in samples of raw sewage. Two of the environmental samples were positive for human specific Bacteroides and one was positive for S. aureus. The PCR screen was negative for other samples and targets, despite exceedance of EPA single sample guidelines for recreational waters on several of the sample dates (5/11 dates). However, estimates of the number of cells delivered to the PCR reaction suggested that few of the samples met the detection limit of the PCR reaction due to a variety of factors. The analysis indicated a need to improve nucleic acid processing in order to enable better delivery of DNA to downstream molecular methods.},

	annote = {Summary It is well recognized that Escherichia coli consists of a number of distinct phylo-groups and that strains of the different phylo-groups vary in their ecological niches, life-history characteristics and propensity to cause disease. Consequently, much can be learnt by assigning a strain of E. coli to one of the recognized phylo-groups. A triplex PCR-based method that enables strains of E. coli to be assigned to a phylogroup using a dichotomous key approach based on the presence or absence of two genes (chuA and yjaA) and an anonymous DNA fragment (TSPE4.C2) has been developed. However, the accuracy with which this method assigns strains to their correct phylo-group has not been adequately evaluated. Consequently, 662 strains of E. coli were characterized using a multi-locus sequence typing approach. Unsupervised population assignment algorithms were used to assign strains to phylo-groups based on the multi-locus sequence typing data. The analyses revealed that 85--90% of E. coli strains can be assigned to a phylo-group and that 80--85% of the phylo-group memberships assigned using the Clermont method are correct. However, the accuracy with which strains are assigned to the correct phylo-group depends on their Clermont genotype. For example, strains yielding a Clermont genotype consistent with phylo-groups B1 and B2 are assigned correctly 95% of the time. Strains failing to yield any PCR products using the Clermont method are seldom members of phylo-group A and strains with such a genotype should not be assigned to a phylo-group.},

	annote = {Field experiments and modeling studies were carried out to characterize the surf zone entrainment and along-shore transport of pollution from two tidal outlets that drain into Huntington Beach and Newport Beach, popular public beaches in southern California. The surf zone entrainment and near-shore transport of pollutants from these tidal outlets appears to be controlled by prevailing wave conditions and coastal currents, and fine-scale features of the flow field around the outlets. An analysis of data from dye experiments and fecal indicator bacteria monitoring studies reveals that the along-shore flux of surf zone water is at least 50 to 300 times larger than the cross-shore flux of surf zone water. As a result, pollutants entrained in the surf zone hug the shore, where they travel significant distances parallel to the beach before diluting to extinction. Under the assumption that all surf zone pollution at Huntington Beach originates from two tidal outlets, the Santa Ana River and Talbert Marsh outlets, models of mass and momentum transport in the surf zone approximately capture the observed tidal phasing and magnitude of certain fecal indicator bacteria groups (total coliform) but not others (Escherichia coli and enterococci), implying the existence of multiple sources of, and/or multiple transport pathways for, fecal pollution at this site. The intersection of human recreation and near-shore pollution pathways implies that, from a human health perspective, special care should be taken to reduce the discharge of harmful pollutants from land-side sources of surface water runoff, such as tidal outlets and storm drains.

	annote = {Antibiotic resistance analysis (ARA), frequency of sampling, and seasonality were evaluated in a rural Virginia watershed dominated by cattle. The selected watershed (Mill Creek) was 3767 ha in size, included two small communities (one sewered and one unsewered), and several farms that when combined contained over 3800 beef and dairy cattle. Monthly monitoring of fecal coliforms at two sampling sites in Mill Creek from January to December, 2001, revealed that the recreational standard (1000 colony forming units, CFUs/100 ml) was exceeded a total of eight times for a 33{\%} violation rate at each site. In addition, stream samples were collected weekly for 4 consecutive weeks during seasonal high flows (March) and seasonal low flows (September--October), plus daily for 7 consecutive days within the weekly schedules for a combined total of 60 stream samples (30 at each of two sites). The recreational standard was exceeded once during seasonal high flow and nine times during seasonal low flow. Microbial source tracking (MST) was performed by ARA to assess the impact of cattle on water quality within the different sampling routines. The resistance patterns of 2880 water isolates and 1158 known source (host-origin) isolates were determined with seven antibiotics at 28 different concentrations. The 1158 isolate database was reduced to 562 unique isolates when clonal ARA patterns were removed. This database of 562 unique isolates had an average rate of correct classification (ARCC) of 95.4{\%}, and several statistical procedures confirmed the library as accurate and representative. Sixty-five percent of 50 challenge-set isolates from sources, but not samples, used in the library were correctly identified. The 562 unique pattern database was used to classify Escherichia coli isolates from water samples into six host source categories. The ARA results showed that cattle were the major source of pollution in the stream and cattle were the dominant source in over 60{\%} of the water samples. Sampling frequency and seasonality had no effect on the MST results, as cattle dominated both seasons and samplings. Deer were a minor contributor in the summer (high water demand), and geese were a minor contributor in the winter when migratory flocks were observed moving through the watershed. An unexpected human allocation was found, especially under seasonal high flow conditions. The exact origin of this human allocation is not known. This project demonstrated that a host-origin library, based on a phenotypic method, could be developed for a well-defined watershed and was both representative of the sources in the watershed and performed reasonably well against a challenge set.},

	annote = { Aims: The aim of this study was to identify and characterize the population of Enterococcus sp. in domestic wastewater as it flows through a constructed wetland. Methods and Results: Four hundred and eighty-four Enterococcus isolates were collected from the inlet, various sites within and from the outlet of a plastic lined constructed wetland in College Station, TX. The wetland treated septic tank effluent that passed sequentially through two 1·89 m3 septic tanks and a 1·89 m3 pump tank allowing 48 l doses at a 24 l min−1 rate. The Enterococcus isolates were identified to species using the commercial Biolog system. The 484 Enterococcus isolates were comprised of ten different species, including Enterococcus faecalis (30·6%), Enterococcus pseudoavium (24·0%), Enterococcus casseliflavus (12·8%), Enterococcus faecium (11·2%), Enterococcus mundtii (7·9%), Enterococcus gallinarum (6·2%), Enterococcus dispar (3·7%), Enterococcus hirae (2·1%), Enterococcus durans and Enterococcus flavescens both 0·8%. Of the 88 isolates collected from the inlet, only 9·1% of the isolates were identified as Ent. faecalis and Ent. pseudoavium (36·4%) was identified as the predominant species. Whereas of the 74 isolates collected from the outlet, the predominant species were identified as Ent. faecalis (29·7%). Species identification varied among sites within the wetland, but often Ent. faecalis was the predominant species. Conclusions: Our data suggest that while Ent. faecalis is the predominant species of Enterococcus found in domestic wastewater, the populations may shift during treatment as the wastewater flows through the constructed wetland. Significance and Impact of the Study: We found that shifts in Enterococcus species composition occurred during domestic wastewater treatment. This has implications for the identification of faecal pollution based on the presence of specific bacterial types associated with domestic wastewater.},

Gastrotrichs and nematodes dominated numerically and were more abundant within the estuary than at open coast beaches, (2 x 106 compared with 8 x 105 animals m-2). Few environmental factors correlated with faunal abundance. Sewage bacteria showed a positive correlation with gastrotrichs at open coast beaches and a negative correlation at sheltered beaches, whereas nematodes showed a positive correlation with sewage bacteria at a sheltered sand beach and a negative correlation at a muddy beach. Annelids did not show correlations with granulometric factors and comprised 98{\%} of the biomass of the muddy area. Using data on annelid species, diversity patterns and a variety of multivariate analyses all showed that at the muddy Seal Sand a central area could be distinguished from a peripheral area. The central area was physically stable and was covered by an algal mat. This area contained the polychaetes Capitella capitata, Polydora ciliata, Streblospio shrubsolii and Manayunkia aestuarina and the oligochaetes Peloscolex benendeni and Tubifex pseudogaster. The macrofauna comprised fewer species when compared with a survey done in 1935; in particular there were fewer species of pelecypods. There were no detectable effects of pollution on the meiofauna; the numbers of organisms and total biomass were comparable with those of other temperate estuaries.},

	annote = {In order to assess the microbial water quality in canal waters throughout the Florida Keys, a survey was conducted to determine the concentration of microbial fecal indicators and the presence of human pathogenic microorganisms. A total of 19 sites, including 17 canal sites and 2 nearshore water sites, were assayed for total coliforms, fecal coliforms, Escherichia coli, Clostridium perfringens, enterococci, coliphages, F-specific (F1) RNA coliphages, Giardia lamblia, Cryptosporidium parvum, and human enteric viruses (polioviruses, coxsackie A and B viruses, echoviruses, hepatitis A viruses, Norwalk viruses, and small round-structured viruses). Numbers of coliforms ranged from <1 to 1,410, E. coli organisms from <1 to 130, Clostridium spp. from <1 to 520, and enterococci from <1 to 800 CFU/100 ml of sample. Two sites were positive for coliphages, but no F1 phages were identified. The sites were ranked according to microbial water quality and compared to various water quality standards and guidelines. Seventy-nine percent of the sites were positive for the presence of enteroviruses by reverse transcriptase PCR (polioviruses, coxsackie A and B viruses, and echoviruses). Sixty-three percent of the sites were positive for the presence of hepatitis A viruses. Ten percent of the sites were positive for the presence of Norwalk viruses. Ninety-five percent of the sites were positive for at least one of the virus groups. These results indicate that the canals and nearshore waters throughout the Florida Keys are being impacted by human fecal material carrying human enteric viruses through current wastewater treatment strategies such as septic tanks. Exposure to canal waters through recreation and work may be contributing to human health risks.},

	annote = {A microbiological water quality study of Homosassa Springs State Wildlife Park (HSSWP) and surrounding areas was undertaken. Samples were collected in November of 1997 (seven sites) and again in November of 1998 (nine sites). Fecal bacterial concentrations (total and fecal coliforms, Clostridium perfringens, and enterococci) were measured as relative indicators of fecal contamination. F+-specific coliphage genotyping was performed to determine the source of fecal contamination at the study sites. Bacterial levels were considerably higher at most sites in the 1997 sampling compared to the 1998 sampling, probably because of the greater rainfall that year. In November of 1997, 2 of the 7 sites were in violation of all indicator standards and guidance levels. In November of 1998, 1 of 9 sites was in violation of all indicator standard and guidance levels. The highest concentrations of all fecal indicators were found at a station downstream of the animal holding pens in HSSWP. The lowest levels of indicators were found at the Homosassa Main Spring vent. Levels of fecal indicators downstream of HSSWP (near the point of confluence with the river) were equivalent to those found in the Southeastern Fork and areas upstream of the park influences. F+ specific RNA coliphage analysis indicated that fecal contamination at all sites that tested positive was from animal sources (mammals and birds). These results suggest that animal (indigenous and those in HSSWP) and not human sources influenced microbial water quality in the area of Homosassa River covered by this study.},

Each method was evaluated with respect to its ability to detect the target organism, absence of signal in the negative controls and repeatability among replicates. Only six of the 30 methods detected their targets in at least 75{\%} of the samples while consistently determining the absence of the target in the negative controls. Among quantitative methods, QPCR for Bacteroides thetaiotamicron and Enterococcus detected by Luminex reliably identified all but one sample containing human fecal material and produced no false positive results. Among non-quantitative methods, the Enterococcus esp gene, the Bacteroidales human specific marker and culture-based coliphage were the most reliable for identifying human fecal material. We also found that investigator-specific variations of methods targeting the same organism often produced different results.},

	annote = {Fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) are commonly used to assess the threat of pathogen contamination in coastal and inland waters. Unlike most measures of pollutant levels however, FIB concentration metrics, such as most probable number (MPN) and colony-forming units (CFU), are not direct measures of the true in situ concentration distribution. Therefore, there is the potential for inconsistencies among model and sample-based water quality assessments, such as those used in the Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) program. To address this problem, we present an innovative approach to assessing pathogen contamination based on water quality standards that impose limits on parameters of the actual underlying FIB concentration distribution, rather than on MPN or CFU values. Such concentration-based standards link more explicitly to human health considerations, are independent of the analytical procedures employed, and are consistent with the outcomes of most predictive waterquality models. We demonstrate how compliance with concentration-based standards can be inferred from traditional MPN values using a Bayesian inference procedure. This methodology, applicable to a wide range of FIB-based water quality assessments, is illustrated here using fecal coliform data from shellfish harvesting waters in the Newport River Estuary, North Carolina. Results indicate that areas determined to be compliant according to the current methods-based standards may actually have an unacceptably high probability of being in violation of concentration-based standards. {\copyright}2008 American Chemical Society.},

Samples were collected from November 2, 2006, to March 20, 2007, from eight subsurface drains under field plots that received no LDME and no tillage (controls) or received 4,000 or 8,000 gallons per acre (gal/acre) of LDME and either no tillage or two different types of tillage. The two types of tillage tested were (1) ground-driven, rotary, subsurface cultivation and (2) rolling-tine aeration. Samples were collected before LDME application and at 4 hours, and 1, 2, 6, 7, and 14 days post-application. Nutrient concentrations were high in subsurface-drain water throughout the field-trial period and could not be attributed to the field-trial LDME application. Of the 59 drain-water samples, including those collected before LDME application and control samples for each date, 56 had concentrations greater than the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA), Ecoregion VI recommended surface-water criterion for total phosphorus, and all samples had concentrations greater than the recommended total nitrogen criterion. Nitrate + nitrite nitrogen concentration exceeded 20 milligrams per liter for every sample and contributed most to the total nitrogen concentrations. Substantial increases in drain-water concentrations of organic and ammonia nitrogen and total phosphorus were found for all treatments, including controls, at 14 days post-application after 0.84 inch of rainfall over 2 days. E. coli concentrations exceeded the USEPA recreational-water-quality single-sample criterion of 235 colony forming units per 100 milliliters in only 3 of 56 samples. Of these three samples, two were collected within 1 day post-LDME application from the treatment receiving 8,000 gal/acre LDME with no tillage (NT8000). The third sample was from the rolling-tine aerator treatment with 4,000 gal/acre LDME application rate after the first significant rainfall. Two wastewater chemicals and two bacterial genes (eaeA and stx1) detected in the LDME, but absent in field blank or pre-application samples, were detected in the 4-hour or 1-day post-application NT8000 samples. No LDME-associated chemicals were detected in later samples from the NT8000 treatment, and none were detected in samples from other treatments after the first significant rainfall. Results of this field trial were somewhat equivocal with respect to the influence of LDME concentration and tillage practices on subsurface-drain water quality, both immediately after LDME application and in the longer term, after significant rainfall. Interpretation of study findings is limited by the fact that treatments were not replicated, and flow rate or discharge from the subsurface drains was not measured. Nevertheless, study results provide useful information about nutrient and bacteria concentrations in subsurface drains during the non-growing season. In addition, study results demonstrate some potential for the use of chemical and microbiological indicators of LDME transport to subsurface drains.},

	annote = { The objective of this study was to compare fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) (fecal coliforms, Escherichia coli [EC], and enterococci [ENT]) concentrations with a wide array of typical organic wastewater chemicals and selected bacterial genes as indicators of fecal pollution in water samples collected at or near 18 surface water drinking water intakes. Genes tested included esp (indicating human-pathogenic ENT) and nine genes associated with various animal sources of shiga-toxin-- producing EC (STEC). Fecal pollution was indicated by genes and/or chemicals for 14 of the 18 tested samples, with little relation to FIB standards. Of 13 samples with <50 EC 100 mL−1, human pharmaceuticals or chemical indicators of wastewater treatment plant effl uent occurred in six, veterinary antibiotics were detected in three, and stx1 or stx2 genes (indicating varying animal sources of STEC) were detected in eight. Only the EC eaeA gene was positively correlated with FIB concentrations. Human-source fecal pollution was indicated by the esp gene and the human pharmaceutical carbamazepine in one of the nine samples that met all FIB recreational water quality standards. Escherichia coli rfbO157 and stx2c genes, which are typically associated with cattle sources and are of potential human health signifi cance, were detected in one sample in the absence of tested chemicals. Chemical and gene-based indicators of fecal contamination may be present even when FIB standards are met, and some may, unlike FIB, indicate potential sources. Application of multiple water quality indicators with variable environmental persistence and fate may yield greater confi dence in fecal pollution assessment and may inform remediation decisions},

	annote = {Management of environmental health issues is an integral part of public health systems. An active integrated environmental health surveillance and response system was developed for the Athens Olympics to monitor and prevent exposure to environmental hazards. The potential for permanent implementation of the program was examined. Methods The environmental health surveillance and response system included standardization, computerization and electronic transmission of data concerning environmental inspections of 17 site categories (restaurants, swimming pools etc) of public health interest, drinking and recreational water examinations and suggested corrective actions. The Olympic Planning Unit integrated and centrally managed data from 13 public health agencies, recommended, supervised and coordinated prompt corrective actions. Methods used to test the effectiveness of the program were the assessment of water quality test and inspection results trends over time using linear regression and epidemiological surveillance findings. Results Between January 2003 and September the 30th, 2004, 196 inspectors conducted 8562 inspections, collected 5024 water samples and recommended 17 027 corrective actions. In 10 cruise ships used as floating hotels inspectors conducted 10 full inspections, 2 re-inspections, and 27 follow-up inspections. Unsatisfactory inspection results (r = 0.44, p < 0.0001) and positive water quality tests (r = 0.39, p < 0.001) presented an overall decrease trend over time. In August, 2003, an outbreak of salmonellosis was linked to a hotel restaurant which accommodated athletes during a test event. Conclusion Lessons learned for future events include timely implementation and installation of communication processes, and rapid and coordinated response to unsatisfactory inspection results. Routine national programs need to adopt enhanced environmental health surveillance aimed at public health decision-making, but with a different perspective.},

Campylobacters, Escherichia coli, or other coliforms have rarely been detected in potential sources. We studied three waterborne outbreaks in Finland caused by C. jejuni and used sample volumes of 4,000 to 20,000 ml for analysis of campylobacters and sample volumes of 1 to 5,000 ml for analysis of coliforms and E. coli, depending on the sampling site. Multiple samples obtained from possible sources (water distribution systems and environmental water sources) and the use of large sample volumes (several liters) increased the chance of detecting the pathogen C. jejuni in water. Filtration of a large volume (1,000 to 2,000 ml) also increased the rate of detection of coliforms and E. coli. To confirm the association between drinking water contamination and illness, a combination of Penner serotyping and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (digestion with SmaI and KpnI) was found to be useful. This combination reliably verified similarity or dissimilarity of C. jejuni isolates from patient samples, from drinking water, and from other environmental sources, thus confirming the likely reservoir of an outbreak.},

All fish were collected during fall 2006 from Southworth Marsh in the Duluth-Superior Harbor, a public beach that is commonly posted to minimize water contact due to high E. coli levels. Although fecal coliform bacteria were isolated from each fish species, they were only isolated from 66{\%} and 72{\%} of the individual benthic and pelagic fish, respectively. While 42{\%} of the fecal coliforms from benthic fish were E. coli, only 4{\%} of these bacteria from pelagic fish were E. coli. Cluster analysis showed different fish species harbored identical strains of E. coli and some fish contained multiple E. coli strains. The potential source for 65{\%} of the E. coli isolates obtained from fish were identified by using the HFERP DNA fingerprinting method and libraries of E. coli DNA fingerprints from warm-blooded animals and environmental isolates collected in the area. The E. coli strains whose source could be identified were most similar to strains isolated from sediments, Canada geese, mallard ducks, and wastewater. None of the fish E. coli had DNA fingerprints matching those from any water or beach sand isolates. Although our results demonstrate that benthic fish contain E. coli, it may be more appropriate to consider these fish as a vector of E. coli from other sources, rather than a new source of E. coli contamination in aquatic environments.},

Strain identity was determined using horizontal fluorophore-enhanced repetitive element palindromic DNA fingerprinting. Multivariate statistics were used to determine if spatial or temporal changes in E. coli populations occurred in waterfowl species. Pairwise multivariate analyses of variance revealed that E. coli populations of adult gulls from three regions of Lake Michigan and the Wisconsin shore of Lake Superior were similar to one another but different from an E. coli population of gulls from the Duluth region of Lake Superior. Juvenile and adult gulls from the Duluth area harbored different E. coli populations. The E. coli strains ! from juvenile gulls, however, were similar to those found in juvenile terns obtained from the same island rookery. Temporal changes in E. coli populations from several waterfowl species were also demonstrated for this site. Although portions of source tracking databases might be successfully used in other geographic regions, it is clear that juvenile birds should not be the sole source of E. coli strains used for source tracking databases, and multiple-year libraries should be constructed in order to identify the potential sources of E. coli in the environment.},

In response to environmental concerns about sewage ocean outfalls, the Water Board commissioned this study of recreational use of six popular surfing beaches located north and south of Sydney Harbour. A survey sample of 2003 recruits was enrolled on which 43,175 swimming events were recorded. Of these, 5879 (14{\%}) had possibly attributable illness, A rise in relative risks was noted for total illness and respiratory illness but not for gastrointestinal illness. The relative risks for total illness in males rose from 1.79 in high frequency beach swimmers to 2.26 when high frequency beach swimming was combined with swimming at non-ocean sites. Females showed an increase in reported illness when beach swimming was combined with non-ocean swimming. This study lends no support to the concept of correlating health risk in swimmers with threshold levels of currently used bacterial indicator organisms.

General details are given of numerical models used for flow and water quality concentration predictions in estuarine waters, with particular application to the challenges occurring along the South Wales coast. A highly accurate and non-diffusive finite difference scheme that solves the transport equation for predicting water quality indicators and suspended sediment concentration distributions is also discussed. In particular, details are outlined of the extension of the water quality indicators of faecal coliforms, as required to comply with the EU Bathing Water Directive, to predict health risk assessment, in the form of predicting the risk of gastroenteritis.Three example research projects along the South Wales coast are described; the projects involve the application of two-dimensional and three-dimensional hydroenvironmetal models to predict flow patterns and water quality indicator organism distributions in the coastal receiving waters. These studies include: (i) a curvilinear finite difference approach to modelling flows in the Bristol Channel, (ii) coastal health risk predictions in Swansea Bay using combined water quality and epidemiological models, and (iii) combined sewer overflow discharges into Cardiff Bay. {\copyright}2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Recent work has questioned the robustness of traditional indicators, particularly at seawater bathing beaches. For example, a study of Florida beaches found unexpectedly high abundances of Escherichia coli, fecal coliforms, and enterococci in beach sand. The aim of the present study was to explain these abundances by assessing the survival off. coli and enterococci in beach sand relative to seiwatet. We used a combination of quantitative laboratory mesocosm experiments and field observations. Results suggested that E. coli and enteroccocci exhibited increased survivability and growth in sand relative to seawater. Because fecal bacteria are capable of replicating in sand, at least undet controlled laboratory conditions, the results suggest that sand may be an important reservoir of metabolically active fecal organisms. Experiments with "natural" mesocosms (i.e., unsterilized sand or water rich in micropredators and native bacteria) failed to show the same increases in fecal indicators as was found, in sterile sand. It is postulated that this was due to predation and competition with indigenous bacteria in these "natural" systems. Nonetheless, high populations of indicators were maintained and recovered from sand over the duration of the experiment as opposed to the die-off noted in water. Indicator bacteria may wash out of sand into shoreline waters during weather and tidal events, thereby decreasing the effectiveness of these indicators as predictors of health risk and complicating the interprerations for water quality managers.

All methods detected targets in human sewage seeded into buffer, freshwater or marine water (100{\%} sensitivity). The limit of detection (LOD) for human sewage was lowest for the Bacteroidales assay (10−5--10−6 dilution). LODs for HPyVs and M. smithii assays were similar to each other (10−3--10−4), but were higher than Bacteroidales. The HPyVs assay was 100{\%} specific, showing no cross-reactivity to dog, cow, cat, bird, or wild animal feces among >300 samples from three Gulf Coast regions. The human Bacteroidales assay was 96{\%} specific, but cross-reacted with 10{\%} of dog and some chicken samples. The M. smithii assay was 98{\%} specific with limited cross-reactivity with cow, dog and seagull samples. An experts'workshop concluded that all methods showed sufficient accuracy and reliability to move forward. SOPs will be distributed to collaborating laboratories for further inter-laboratory comparison, and field validation will occur in year 2.},

The virus concentrations varied widely between 0.001 and 570/liter. The same cell line also supported growth of reoviruses, which were abundant in winter (up to 95% of the viruses detected) and scarce in summer (less than 15%). The concentrations of three groups of model organisms in relation to virus concentrations were also studied. The concentrations of bacteria (thermotolerant coliforms and fecal streptococci) were significantly correlated with virus concentrations in river water and coagulated secondary effluent, but were relatively low in disinfected effluents and relatively high in surface water open to nonhuman fecal pollution. The concentrations of F-specific RNA bacteriophages (FRNA phages) were highly correlated with virus concentrations in all environments studied except raw and biologically treated sewage. Numerical relationships were consistent over the whole range of environments; the regression equations for FRNA phages on viruses in river water and lake water were statistically equivalent. These relationships support the possibility that enteric virus concentrations can be predicted from FRNA phage data.},

By modern standards, the direct identification of pathogens as a microbiological parameter for evaluating the hygienically relevant situation is no longer suitable for adequately determining the quality of recreational waters quickly and at a justifiable expenditure E. coli is nowadays looked upon as the most reliable indicator of faecal pollution and consequently of the degree of a potential infection hazard. Bathers must expect exposure to health risks, if waste water containing human and animal excrements is discharged into the waters used for recreational purposes such as bathing and swimming. Pollution originating from the bathers themselves plays only a subordinate role with regard to a possible risk of infection in natural recreational waters. The example of germs from the typhoid-paratyphoid group demonstrates that slight pollution by waste water entails no serious risk of infection for the bathers. The Code of Practice dated February 5, 1976 laid down by the Council of the European Community must be regarded as a basis for monitoring the water quality of recreational waters. This guideline assumes that in addition to a visual inspection samples taken at the bathing places are examined for their content of coliform bacteria (total coliforms and faecal coliforms). Further checks for Salmonella and viruses are required under certain conditions which, however, have not been defined satisfactorily. The examination procedures specified, and this applies to coliform bacteria too, are not satisfactory with respect to the limit values established. Since the EC Code of Practice specifies minimum requirements only, a more comprehensive solution should be sought in the Federal Republic of Germany at the regional level.},

The development and implementation of bacterial TMDLs has proven challenging and often difficult due to unknown source(s) of FIB. This study found that FIB levels varied significantly in flowing water, ponded water, and associated sediment. FIB levels in isolated ponded water in waterways were significantly higher than in flowing water. Sediment under ponded water contained a great amount of FIB. Furthermore, FIB concentrations in ponded water tended to increase with increasing water temperature and to decrease with increasing water salinity. The result provides the field evidence of survival/growth of FIB in water and sediment under ambient conditions in southern California. A holistic approach including natural sources (e.g., a reference system) should be considered for practical and applicable purposes while developing and implementing bacterial TMDLs for pathogen-impaired waterbodies.},

In order to develop an appropriate storm water management strategy for the Fylde coast it was necessary to integrate a number of mathematical models simulating the hydraulic behaviour of the sewerage system and the dispersion of discharges in the receiving waters. From the sewerage system modelling it was apparent that frequent discharges of storm water to the bathing waters could only be avoided by the provision of considerable additional storage in the system. By means of a suitably calibrated simplified sewer model it was possible to investigate the volumes of storm water generated by a 15 year record of local rainfall when different amounts of extra storage and different pumping regimes were employed. The results from these investigations were used to determine the probable concentrations of faecal bacteria in the coastal waters for each of the 15 bathing seasons and determine the percentage of time for which faecal coliform concentrations exceeded the Bathing Water directive standards for the model grid cells representing the identified bathing waters. As a result of the extensive integrated modelling programme for the Fylde coast it has been possible to design a base flow and storm water management system which should maximize the flow passed forward for treatment whilst also ensuring that there is just sufficient storage to ensure protection of the towns from flooding and the compliance of the beaches with the Bathing Water Directive standards.},

The discharge characteristics of the existing sewerage systems were examined by means of an extensive WASSP model, validated by means of flow measurements gathered from critical points of the sewer network. This model was then used, in conjunction with a time series rainfall record for the area, to investigate the effect of the intensity and duration of rainfall events on the volume of storm sewage to be discharged. Because the area is drained by a combined system, the management of storm water is of utmost importance and the output of the WASSP model was used to determine the input to the coastal dispersion model for rainfall events. A preliminary examination of the possible sites for sewage treatment works and sea outfalls, for sewage and storm water, suggested four possible schemes involving either inland treatment, marine treatment or a combination of the two. All options required the discharge of storm water to the sea. Extensive dispersion modelling was carried out to examine the probable effects of various stormwater management strategies on bacterial concentrations in the receiving waters. From this it was apparent that storage of storm flows, with controlled discharge, at the state of tide when environmental impact would be minimal, was required to achieve compliance with the provisions of the Directive. By integrating the WASSP modelling of various base-flow and storm-water storage options with dispersion modelling, it was possible to establish appropriate design criteria.},

Real-time estimates of bacteria concentrations were made using multivariate linear regression models and real-time input data. Probability distribution functions based on the model results and their associated variances were used to determine the probability that predicted bacteria levels exceed water quality standards. The models were developed for the Mystic River watershed, an urban watershed near Boston, using Enterococcus bacteria data measured during the summers of 2002 and 2003. The linear regression models had adjusted-R2 values of 0.55-0.82 for two river sites, and 0.42 for both a beach on a lake and a boathouse near a dam. Independent variables with predictive power included precipitation and the time since the last rainfall.

The frequency of wind from the direction of the effluent water entry might play a role in the occurrence of viruses at a given point of measurement.

	annote = {A number of bacterial, viral, and other diseases can be contracted by man through exposure to sewage-polluted bathing water or beach sand. The increasing use of the sea for recreation has led to major concern regarding health hazards to both local and tourist populations. Epidemiological studies attempting to correlate microbiological water quality with health effects have produced different results, leading to a wide variation in recreational water quality criteria and standards applied, and to considerable controversy regarding their implementation. The Mediterranean provides a good example of a problem region. Coastal pollution by sewage is still a major concern and control measures vary considerably. A number of microbiological/epidemiological studies have been carried out since 1953 in an attempt to define the levels of risk following exposure to different concentrations of bacteria in bathing waters. Practically all studies showed higher morbidity among bathers as compared to non-bathers, but correlation between specific symptoms and bacterial indicator concentrations varied considerably. On the basis of the 1972-1978 Cabelli Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) study in the U.S., later developed by EPA into a recommended health-effects criterion for marine recreational water, one would expect 25-40 gastrointestinal cases per 1,000 persons exposed to seawater containing 100 enterococci per 100 ml. Much more work is needed, however, before a satisfactory dose- response relationship is obtained, principally because of confounding factors inherent in all studies carried out so far, which still require a solution.

The lake was intensively sampled during two 5-day periods in late May-early June, and in July of 1976. The main detectable sources of fecal coliform were cattle watering sites, farms, public beaches, some flooded and substandard septic tanks, and a bird sanctuary. The impairment of water quality was localized to shoreline locations near the suspected source of the input of bacteria. After rainfall, about a 10-fold increase was noted in the levels of fecal coliforms and fecal streptococci in all lake surface water sampled. The effect was short-lived lasting only 2 or 3 days after the main rainfall. The levels of indicator bacteria were low and did not exceed maximum levels set down for Water Quality Management in Ontario, of 1000 TC(100 ml)-1 and 100 FC(100 ml)-1 at recreational areas. For this lake and six others in southern Ontario, the LOG of spring densities of aerobic heterotrophic this lake and six others in southern Ontario, the LOG of spring densities of aerobic heterotrophic bacteria correlated significantly with the LOG of mean summer chlorophyll a concentration (r = 0.80). Cottagers on Mississippi Lake were surveyed for their swimming habits and for the incidence of disease associated with swimming. The largest cause of disease associated with bathing, 57 of 67 reported infections, was infection of the ear; 3.28{\%} of bathers at shoreline cottages suffered ear infections. The frequency of ear infections in the population of swimmers was significantly associated with the amount of swimming in the lake. Males and females were infected at equal rates. Young people suffered a significantly higher rate of ear infections than adult bathers. Frequency of water contact was probably greater in young people than in adults and may explain the greater number of ear infections in young swimmers. These studies provided the basis for recommendations designed to improve lakewater quality.},

There is a great need for the development of more rapid, accurate, and low-cost techniques for determining bacteriological water quality. Coliphages seem to be an excellent alternative. A method has been developed to analyze large volumes of pristine water; the method was then compared to a commonly used direct method. The new method involves the filtration of water through positively charged filters and a virus-elution step. The eluent is then mixed with culture medium , a host bacterium, and incubated. Pristine tropical rivers, water collected from bromeliads (epiphytic vegetation), sewage-contaminated waters, and marine waters, and marine waters , were sampled. Concentrations of indicator bacteria were higher than recommended levels for recreational waters, including bromeliad waters. Indicator levels were higher in bromeliad waters than in sewage-contaminated rivers. Phages were isolated only from waters being used for recreational purposes and from sites known to be contaminated with domestic sewage, but not from pristine or bromeliad waters. These results suggest that there is a correlation between the presence of coliphages and fecal contamination. This further suggests that coliphages may be reliable indicators of fecal contamination in the environment. (See also W92-00963) (Author's abstract) 35 013953021},

The pupose of this study is to identify which bacterial markers are more appropriate for measuring water quality and environmental health from the microbiological point of view, in two beaches of the Venezuelan Caribbean coast. It was found that fecal coliforms and enterococci are the most appropriate markers to determine the presence of contamination of fecal origin in the body of water. Also, the detection and quantification of fecal coliforms in tissues of Tivela mactroides is a good indicator of the risk associated with the consumption of raw or slightly cooked marine products. Quantification of bacterial markers in marine ecosystems is relevant as it allows to estimate bacteriological quality and potential risks to public health after the use of the water with touristic purposes or the harvesting of marine products.

	annote = {Hookworm-related cutaneous larva migrans is caused by the migration of animal hookworm larvae in the human skin. The disease mainly occurs in resource-poor communities in the developing world, but it is also reported sporadically in high-income countries and in tourists who have visited the tropics. Diagnosis is made clinically in the presence of a linear serpiginous track moving forward in the skin, associated with itching and a history of exposure. Itching is typically very intense and can prevent patients from sleeping. Bacterial superinfection occurs as a result of scratching. Treatment is based on oral drugs (albendazole or ivermectin) or the topical application of tiabendazole. To control hookworm-related cutaneous larva migrans at the community level, regular treatment of dogs and cats with anthelmintic drugs is necessary, but this is seldom feasible in resource-poor settings. Animals should be banned from beaches and playgrounds. For protection at the individual level, unprotected skin should not come into contact with possibly contaminated soil. {\copyright}2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Results are displayed in real time as bar graphs, and up to three, 4-sample assays can be run on the charge of the 12 V portable battery pack. The HANAA was evaluated for detection of defined Escherichia coli strains, and wild-type colonies isolated from stream water, using PCR for the lac Z and Tir genes. PCR reactions using SYBR Green dye allowed detection of E. coli ATCC 11775 and E. coli O157:H7 cells in under 30 min of assay time; however, background fluorescence associated with dye binding to nonspecific PCR products was present. DNA extracted from three isolates of Bacillus anthracis Ames, linked to a bioterrorism incident in Washington DC in October 2001, were also successfully tested on the HANAA using primers for the vrrA and capA genes. Positive results were observed at 32 and 22 min of assay time, respectively. A TaqMan probe specific to the aroQ gene of Erwinia herbicola was tested on the HANAA and when 500 cells were used as template, positive results were observed after only 7 min of assay time. Background fluorescence associated with the use of the probe was negligible. The HANAA is unique in offering real time PCR in a handheld format suitable for field use; a commercial version of the instrument, offering six reaction chambers, is available as of Fall 2002.},

The influence of the concentration of easily assimilable organic carbon (AOC) in water on clogging was investigated in filter beds operated under well-defined laboratory conditions using acetate as a model substrate. Acetate concentrations in the water as low as 0.01 mg C/l promoted clogging with the main head loss, caused by bacterial growth, in the first centimeter of the sand bed. An empirical model was developed describing a linear relationship between the operation period to reach a certain increase in head loss (T(Pi)) and the reciprocal value of the acetate concentration or acetate load {$[$}L(ac) g C/(m2 .d){$]$} at a constant filtration rate. The rate of clogging, designated as the microbiological clogging factor (C(f)), is defined by the slope of the linear relationship between the square root of the increase of the head loss (p(i)(1/2)) and the operation time. This linear relationship demonstrated that the increase in clogging rate was constant with time. Observations at several locations with experimental recharge wells revealed that the AOC concentration is an important parameter for the biological clogging potential of water. The AOC concentration of water used for infiltration in a recharge well should be less than 0.01 mg acetate-C equiv/l to prevent biological clogging for a period of more than a year.},

A prospective epidemiological study has been undertaken to determine what the risks are to swimmers in such circumstances and hence to determine the required level of pollution control. The best indicators were found to be E. coli, and staphylococci. The existing limit of acceptability applied in Hong Kong corresponds to a risk of 15 skin and gastrointestinal cases per thousand swimmers, a reasonably low rate but still a significant public health problem when multiplied by the very large number of swimmers using the beaches in Hong Kong every year. -from Author},

Traditionally, it is accepted that due to their small size the physiology of microscopic organisms is not affected by the moving fluid at their scale. In this study, we demonstrate that the small-scale turbulence significantly modulates algal and bacterial nutrient uptake and growth in comparison to still-water control. The rate of energy dissipation emerges as a physically based scaling parameter integrating turbulence across a range of scales and microscopic organism responses at the cell level. Microbiological laboratory tests and bioassays do not consider fluid motion as an important variable in quantifying the physiological responses of microorganisms. A conceptual model of how to integrate the fluid motion in Monod-type kinetics is proposed. We anticipate our findings will encourage researchers to reconsider the laboratory protocols and modeling procedures in the analysis of microorganism physiological responses to changing physical and chemical environments by integrating the effect of turbulence.},

The samples were positive for enteropathogens significantly (P < 0.05) less frequently during the winter season than during the other sampling seasons. No significant differences in the prevalence of enteropathogens were found when rivers and lakes were compared. The presence of thermotolerant coliforms, E. coli, and C. perfringens had significant bivariate nonparametric Spearman's rank order correlation coefficients (P < 0.001) with samples that were positive for one or more of the pathogens analyzed. The absence of these indicators in a logistic regression model was found to have significant predictive value (odds ratios, 1.15 $ 108, 7.57, and 2.74, respectively; P < 0.05) for a sample that was negative for the pathogens analyzed. There were no significant correlations between counts or count levels for thermotolerant coliforms or E. coli or the presence of F-RNA phages and pathogens in the samples analyzed.},

	annote = {This paper reviews research on beach groundwater dynamics and identifies research questions which will need to be answered before swash zone sediment transport and beach profile evolution can be successfully modelled. Beach groundwater hydrodynamics are a result of combined forcing from the tide and waves at a range of frequencies, and a large number of observations exist which describe the shape and elevation of the beach watertable in response to tidal forcing at diurnal, semi-diurnal and spring-neap tidal frequencies. Models of beach watertable response to tidal forcing have been successfully validated; however, models of watertable response to wave forcing are less well developed and require verification. Improved predictions of swash zone sediment transport and beach profile evolution cannot be achieved unless the complex fluid and sediment interactions between the surface flow and the beach groundwater are better understood, particularly the sensitivity of sediment transport processes to flow perpendicular to the permeable bed. The presence of a capillary fringe, particularly when it lies just below the sand surface, has influences on beach groundwater dynamics. The presence of a capillary fringe can have a significant effect on the exchange of water between the ocean and the coastal aquifer, particularly in terms of the storage capacity of the aquifer. Field and laboratory observations have also shown that natural groundwater waves usually propagate faster and decay more slowly in aquifers with a capillary fringe, and observations which suggest that horizontal flows may also occur in the capillary zone have been reported. The effects of infiltration and exfiltration are generally invoked to explain why beaches with a low watertable tend to accrete and beaches with a high watertable tend to erode. However, the relative importance of processes such as infiltration losses in the swash, changes in the effective weight of the sediment, and modified shear stress due to boundary layer thinning, are not yet clear. Experimental work on the influence of seepage flows within sediment beds provides conflicting results concerning the effect on bed stability. Both modelling and experimental work indicates that the hydraulic conductivity of the beach is a critical parameter. However, hydraulic conductivity varies both spatially and temporally on beaches, particularly on gravel and mixed sand and gravel beaches. Another important, but poorly understood, consideration in beach groundwater studies is the role of air encapsulation during the wetting of beach sand.},

There are four antigenically distinct serogroups of F1 RNA coliphages, and those predominating in humans (groups II and III) differ from those predominating in animals (groups I and IV). Hence, it may be possible to distinguish between human and animal wastes by serotyping F1 RNA coliphage isolates. Because serotyping is laborious and requires scarce antiserum reagents, we investigated genotyping using synthetic oligonucleotide probes as an alternative approach to distinguishing the four groups of F1 RNA coliphages. Oligoprobes I, II, III, IV, A, and B were selected to detect group I, II, III, IV, I plus II, and III plus IV phages, respectively. Methods for phage transfer from zones of lysis on a host cell lawn to candidate membrane filters and fixation of genomic nucleic acid on the membranes were optimized. The oligoprobes, which were end labeled with digoxigenin, were applied in DNA-RNA hybridizations, and hybrids were observed by colorimetric, immunoenzymatic detection. Of 203 isolates of F1 RNA coliphages from environmental samples of water, wastes, and shellfish, 99.5 and 96.6% could be classified into each group by serotyping and genotyping, respectively. Probes A and B correctly identified 100% of the isolates. On the basis of these results, this method for genotyping F1 RNA coliphages appears to be practical and reliable for typing isolates in field samples.},

Results suggested that community respiration in Wimereux sandy beach sediments was probably dominated by bacterial respiration and that the estimated benthic bacterial growth efficiency (BGE) was highly variable. Although temperature significantly controlled both BP and BCR during low tide at the annual scale, the temperature effect on BGE was not significant. The instability and sediment erosion caused by the wave action and the tidal cycle were thus thought to influence the BGE. Since the sampling site is regularly affected by Phaeocystis foam deposit (enhancing the BCR and decreasing the BGE), and since GPP rates were highly variable and supported by high assimilation numbers (i.e., >1 mgC mgChla -1 h-1), phytoplankton organic matter deposit following the immersion of the study site was thought to explain the BGE variability. {\copyright}2006 Springer-Verlag.},

	annote = {Water sampling and numerical modeling were used to estimate ground-water nutrient fluxes in the Kihei area of Maui, where growth of macroalgae (seaweed) on coral reefs raises ecologic concerns and accumulation on beaches has caused odor and removal problems. Fluxes and model results are highly approximate, first-order estimates because very few wells were sampled and there are few field data to constrain model calibration. Ground-water recharge was estimated to be 22.6 Mgal/d (million gallons per day) within a 73-square-mile area having a coastline length of 8 miles or 13 km (kilometers). Nearly all of the recharge discharges at the coast because ground-water withdrawals are small. Another 3.0 Mgal/d of tertiary-treated wastewater effluent is injected into the regional aquifer at a County treatment plant midway along the coast and about a mile from shore. The injection plume is 0.93 miles wide (1.5 km) at the shore, as estimated from a three-dimensional numerical ground-water model. Wastewater injected beneath the brackish ground-water lens rises buoyantly and spreads out at the top of the lens, diverting and mixing with ambient ground water. Ground water discharging from the core of the injection plume is less than 5 years old and is about 60 percent effluent at the shore, according to the model. Dissolved nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations in treated effluent were 7.33 and 1.72 milligrams per liter, roughly 6 and 26 times background concentrations at an upgradient well. Background nitrogen and phosphorus fluxes carried by ground water are 7.7 and 0.44 kg/d-km (kilograms per day per kilometer of coast). Injected wastewater fluxes distributed across the plume width are 55 and 13 kg/d-km nitrogen and phosphorus, roughly 7 and 30 times background flux. However, not all of the injected load reaches coastal waters because nutrients are naturally attenuated in the oxygen-depleted effluent plume. Water from a downgradient well reflects this attenuation and provides a more conservative estimate of injection flux approaching the shore: 27 and 1.5 kg/d-km nitrogen and phosphorus, roughly one-half and one-ninth the injection-source estimates, and 3.5 and 3.4 times background flux. Effluent has δ18O and δ2H stable-isotope signatures that are distinct from local ground water, as well as δ15N and δ11B signatures diagnostic of domestic waste and laundry detergents, respectively. Pharmaceuticals and organic wastewater compounds also were present in effluent and the downgradient well. These isotopes and chemicals served as wastewater tracers in Kihei ground water and may be useful tracers in nearshore marine waters and aquifers elsewhere in Hawaii.},

Developed in cooperation with the Hawaii State Department of Health, the survey methodology included instrument trolling to detect submarine groundwater discharge, followed by analysis of water and macroalgae for a suite of chemical and isotopic constituents that constitute a ``multitracer''approach. Surveys were conducted May 6--28, 2008, during fair-weather conditions and included: (1) wading and kayak trolling with a multiparameter water-quality sonde, (2) marine water-column sampling, and (3) collection of benthic algae samples. Instrument trolling helped guide the water sampling strategy by providing dense, continuous transects of water properties on which groundwater discharge zones could be identified. Water and algae samples for costly chemical and isotopic laboratory analyses were last to be collected but were highly diagnostic of wastewater presence and nutrient origin because of low detection levels and confirmation across multiple tracers. Laboratory results confirmed the presence of wastewater constituents in marine water-column samples at both locales and showed evidence of modifying processes such as denitrification and mixing of effluent with surrounding groundwater and seawater. Carbamazepine was the most diagnostic pharmaceutical, detected in several marine water-column samples and effluent at both Kihei and Lahaina. Heavy nitrogen-isotope compositions in water and algae were highly diagnostic of effluent, particularly where enriched to even heavier values than effluent source compositions by denitrification. Algae provided an added advantage of time-integrating their nitrogen source during growth. The measured Kihei plume coincided almost exactly with prior model predictions, but the Lahaina plume was detected well south of the expected direct path from injection wells to shore and may be guided by a buried valley fill from an ancestral course of Honokowai Stream. Nutrient concentrations in upland wells at Lahaina were comparable to concentrations in wastewater but originate instead from agricultural fertilizers. A key factor in detecting and mapping the wastewater plumes was sampling very close to shore (mostly within 20 m or so) and in very shallow water (mostly 0.5 to 2 m depth). Effluent probably discharges somewhat offshore as well, although prior attempts to detect an injected fluorescent tracer at Lahaina in the 1990s were inconclusive, having focused farther offshore in water mostly 10--30 m deep. Sampling of benthic porewater and algae would offer the best chances for further effluent detection and mapping offshore, and sampling of onland monitor wells could provide additional understanding of geochemical processes that take place in the effluent plumes and bring about some degree of natural attenuation of nutrients.},

This study set out to determine whether this was an appropriate development. Methods and Results: A series of Monte Carlo studies compared five non-parametric methods for calculating the 95th percentile with the parametric method and compares results with percentage exceedence. It is shown that the Hazen method gives the closest proximity to the parametric method for calculating 95th percentile values. However, the difference between 95th percentile results and percentage exceedence, as currently used, is trivial compared to uncertainty due to sample variation. Conclusions: It is concluded that a calculated 95th percentile for beach classification offers little advantage compared to percentage exceedence, other than offering a false sense of certainty. Furthermore, the additional calculation needed in determining 95th percentile values will demand electronic calculation, increase the chance of calculation errors and make the results less understandable to beach managers and the general public. Significance and Impact of the Study: This study should encourage the European Commission to keep percent compliance rather than calculation of 95th percentiles in any new bathing water directive.},

The wastes were subsequently spread onto a grass pasture, and the decline of each of the zoonotic agents was monitored over time. There were no significant differences among the decimal reduction times for the bacterial pathogens. The mean bacterial decimal reduction time was 1.94 days. A range of times between 8 and 31 days for a 1-log reduction in C. parvum levels was obtained, demonstrating that the protozoans were significantly more hardy than the bacteria. Oocyst recovery was more efficient from wastes with lower dry matter contents. The levels of most of the zoonotic agents had declined to below detectable levels by 64 days. However, for some waste types, 128 days was required for the complete decline of L. monocytogenes levels. We were unable to find significant differences between the rates of pathogen decline in liquid (slurry) and solid (farmyard manure) wastes, although concerns have been raised that increased slurry generation as a consequence of more intensive farming practices could lead to increased survival of zoonotic agents in the environment.},

Therefore distinct guide and imperative values for fecal indicators are listed in the EC directive about water quality control. The detection methods, however, give laboratories some room to choose their own method, which has led to difficulties in the comparability of results. In 1989 an ad-hoc working group of the coastal countries of Germany established detection methods, which by now are obligatory for these countries. Fecal and total coliforms (FC and TC) are detected by a triplicate mpn-procedure using brilliant green-bile-lactose broth supplemented with tryptophane and 4-methylumbelliferyl-beta-D-glucuronide (BGB-MUG) as selective medium. Gas-, fluorescence- and indole-positive cultures are considered fecal coliform-positive. In the last years rises in TC but not in FC counts were observed in fresh waters. A study was carried out to evaluate the official method in another bathing season, to determine bacterial species leading to false-positive TC cultures and to compare BGB-MUG with laurylsulphate-tryptophane-MUG (LSTB-MUG). Water samples of different salinities and nutrient input were collected in weekly intervals from April to October. FC and TC concentrations were determined and all TC-positive cultures were differentiated further. The FC counts obtained by enrichment in BGB-MUG or LSTB-MUG were nearly identical, the rate of fluorescence-positive, indole-negative tubes being approximately 0.6{\%}. Differentiation of FC-negative cultures showed a false-negative rate of 2.87{\%} for BGB-MUG and of 8{\%} for LSTB-MUG. During the summer months TC counts in BGB-MUG exceeded FC counts by far at most of the sampling sites. This effect was much less pronounced in LSTB-MUG; the difference between both enrichment media being significant. Differentiation of presumptive TC from BGB-MUG resulted in a high percentage of Aeromonas spp. in fresh waters. LSTB-MUG was clearly more selective for TC than BGB-MUG, but still with an average of 10{\%} of the test tubes being false TC-positive (BGB-MUG 46{\%}). The sensitivity of BGB-MUG was below 60{\%} (LSTB-MUG 89{\%}). LSTB-MUG should be preferred as enrichment medium in mpn-examination of recreational water, if no further differentiation is carried out. The selectivity for TC is better than in BGB-MUG and the only slight inhibitory effects can be tolerated.},

In 1998, the parameters E. coli, somatic coliphages (SOMCPH) and F-Specific RNA bacteriophages (FRNAPH) were incorporated into the bathing water quality monitoring system. This enabled the study of the link between bacterial and viral indicators as well as the analysis of the ratios between both types of indicators in waters with different levels of pollution. Although bacterial indicators (total coliforms (TC) and faecal coliforms (FC)) and enterococci showed a strong correlation between them, the correlations between the viral indicators and between the viral and bacterial indicators were weaker, though significant in all cases. The ratio between SOMCPH and E. coli indicates that at low levels of bacterial pollution (E coli 100 MPN/100 ml), SOMCPH numbers are lower than those of E-coli. The data reveal the presence of viral indicators in waters classified as suitable for bathing by the European Directive and alert us to their suitability. {\copyright}IWA Publishing 2007.},

Isolates from all seven cases were confirmed as E. coli serogroup O157 phage type 21/28. We carried out a case-control study among holidaymakers who visited the beach. A standardised questionnaire was administered by telephone to parents. They were asked where on the beach the children had played, whether they had had contact with the stream that flowed across the beach, and about their use of food outlets and sources of food eaten. Cases were more likely to have played in the stream than controls (OR {$[$}1.72- undefined{$]$}). The time spent in the stream by cases was twice spent there by controls. Cases and controls were equally exposed to other suspected risk factors. PFGE profiles for all the cases were indistinguishable. Increased numbers of coliforms were found in the stream prior to the outbreak. Cattle were found grazing upstream. We suggest that the vehicle of infection for an outbreak of acute gastrointestinal illness caused by E. coli O157 was a contaminated freshwater stream flowing across a seaside beach. The onset dates were consistent with a point source. Heavy rainfall in the days preceding the outbreak might have lead to faeces from the cattle potentially contaminated by E. coli O157 contaminating the stream, thereby leading to the outbreak. Control measures included fencing off the part of the stream in which children played, and putting up warning signs around the beach.},

Although there were no differences in population sizes of heterotrophic bacteria, the temperature of AS700 compost was more variable and did not become as high as that of control compost. There were significant differences in water content, total carbon (C), total nitrogen (N), and electrical conductivity but not in the C/N ratio or pH between the two compost treatments. Campylobacteria were readily isolated from pen manure, for up to day 15 from control compost, and throughout the active phase of AS700 compost. Campylobacter DNA (including Campylobacter coli, Campylobacter fetus, Campylobacter hyointestinalis, and Campylobacter jejuni) was detected over the ca. 10-month composting period, and no reductions in quantities of C. jejuni DNA were observed over the duration of the active phase. The utilization of centrifugation in combination with ethidium monoazide (EMA) significantly reduced (>90{\%}) the amplification of C. jejuni DNA that did not originate from cells with intact cell membranes. No differences were observed in the frequency of Campylobacter DNA detection between EMA- and non-EMA-treated samples, suggesting that Campylobacter DNA amplified from compost was extracted from cells with intact cell membranes (i.e., from viable cells). The findings of this study indicate that campylobacteria excreted in cattle feces persist for long periods in compost and call into question the common belief that these bacteria do not persist in manure.},

Recently, research efforts have been directed towards the identification of potential sources of fecal contamination impacting waterways and beaches. This is often referred to as microbial source tracking. However, recent studies have reported that E. coli can become "naturalized" to soil, sand, sediments, and algae in tropical, subtropical, and temperate environments. This phenomenon raises issues concerning the continued use of this bacterium as an indicator of fecal contamination. In this review, we discuss the relationship between E. coli and fecal pollution and the use of this bacterium as an indicator of fecal contamination in freshwater systems. We also discuss recent studies showing that E. coli can become an active member of natural microbial communities in the environment, and how this bacterium is being used for microbial source tracking. We also discuss the impact of environmentally-"naturalized" E. coli populations on water quality.},

	annote = {This is the first report on fecal pollution using molecular markers in Southeast Asia where serious sewage pollution has occurred. A simple and sensitive analytical method using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry for 10 sterols in various environmental samples was developed to monitor extensive areas of tropical Asia. First, the method was applied to wastewater to confirm that >95% of sterols existed in the particulate phase. Then the approach was applied to a tropical Asian region, Malaysia and Vietnam, with a selection of 59 sampling stations in total. River water and sediment samples were collected and analyzed for chemical markers (coprostanol and other sterols) and microbiological markers (fecal coliforms and fecal streptococci). Particulate coprostanol concentrations ranged from <0.0001 to 13.47 {\'\i}g/L in tropical river and estuarine waters, indicating severe fecal pollution in populous areas. Coprostanol concentrations in the sediments ranged from 0.005 to 15.5 {\'\i}g/g-dry. The sedimentary coprostanol concentrations were lower than those reported in some urban areas of industrialized countries. This is probably because frequent heavy rain induces intensive input of eroded soil, which dilutes fecal material in river sediments. The relationship between the concentrations of fecal sterols and bacterial indicators was examined in an attempt to develop public health criteria for coprostanol levels applicable to the tropical region. Coprostanol concentrations of 30-100 ng/L or percent coprostanol levels of 2% corresponded to $1000 fecal coliforms per 100 mL, which is set for secondary contact limit in many countries. These coprostanol concentrations were lower than those proposed as criteria in temperate countries, probably owing to greater survival of bacteria in warmer tropical waters. On the basis of these criteria, extensive monitoring of sediments suggests that poor sanitary conditions exist in most of the urbanized area of Malaysia and in several urban and rural sites in Vietnam.},

As a result many segments of the river are listed as impaired on Virginia's 303(d) Total Maximum Daily Load Priority List. The Virginia Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) has evaluated the water samples and has performed source characterization through a process called Bacterial Source Tracking, or 'BST'. The data obtained for the Lynnhaven River Watershed indicate that as much as 25{\%} of the fecal coliform pollution in the closed shellfish areas can be attributed to human sources. To better understand the problem, in 2004 the City of Virginia Beach took the initiative to investigate potential sources of sanitary wastewater that may be entering the Lynnhaven River via the storm drainage system. The City's consultant proposed an innovative technique to monitor human waste signatures. Optical brighteners monitoring (OBM) is a promising new technique to detect the presence or absence of human sewage in receiving waters. This paper will describe OBM as an emerging technique to quickly and cost-effectively facilitate a comprehensive survey of illicit discharge entering the storm sewer system. Furthermore, the paper discusses in-house testing, optimal selection of sites, detailed monitoring, and grab sampling.},

The number of FC and ABR-FC in clam and water samples were compared and a higher number was detected in clams than in water. Five isolates of Salmonella from clams were also multidrug resistant. The data suggests that clam can be used as a bioindicator of seawater pollution and is preferable to direct testing of water. The resistance to antibiotics in E. coli isolated from water and clams collected at the same time and site was of similar pattern and was determined by R-plasmid.},

Studies of sewage field dispersion, as determined through microbial analysis, demonstrated the feasibility of aerospace technology transfer, while providing environmentally valuable data. As a result of the study, the following conclusions were drawn with respect to Huntington Beach offshore waters: ocean thermoclines effectively hold sewage effluents below the surface, and, in particular, below the thermocline; the thermocline loses its effectiveness and eventually becomes non existent during the winter months; during times of weak or no thermoclines, sewage effluent rises to the surface, with decreasing numbers of sewage type organisms as depth increases. It is recommended that there be further studies to determine if the winter thermocline disappearance off Huntington Beach is a common annual occurrence, whether this phenomenon happens at other locales, and what mechanisms are involved.},

The following indicators were included: faecal coliform bacteria, faecal streptococci, sorbitol-fermenting bifidobacteria, Rhodococcus coprophilus, somatic and male-specific coliphages, phages of Bacteroides fragilis, and cytopathogenic viruses. Comparative tests were carried out on samples collected from a stream and river exposed to predominantly faecal pollution of domestic animal origin, and the same stream and river after downstream exposure to run-off from a low socio-economic informal settlement with restricted sanitation. Samples were from perennial flow during the dry season and from stormwater runoff after thundershowers. Stormwater run-off from the settlement reached faecal coliform counts of up to 4 4000 000 per 100 ml, which is equivalent to that of many raw sewage effluents. Faecal pollution was less during the dry season. Sorbitol-fermenting bifidobacteria were identifiable with faecal pollution of human origin, and R coprophilus bacteria with that of animal origin. The ratio of faecal coliforms to faecal streptococci was in the order of 3.5 to 4.7 immediately after exposure to sewage pollution of human origin. In water exposed faecal pollution predominantly of animal origin, and downstream from pollution of human origin, this ratio varied from 0.8 to 1.7, which indicates that ratio under circumstances may also distinguish between faecal pollution of human and animal origin. Phages of B fragilis and cytopathogenic viruses were not detected by direct titration in any of the samples, which implies that their applications in this situation would require more sensitive techniques. The results show that the run-off from the informal settlement constituted a major source of pollution for a river catchment which downstream is used as a source of water for human consumption, and that faecal pollution of human and animal origin can reliably be distinguished by means of combinations of appropriate indicators.},

	annote = {Public water in South Africa is protected from pollution from urban areas and industries through various forms of wastewater treatment and enforced by legislation and standards. However, hardly any standard or guideline exists for an acceptable quality for urban run-off such as stormwater. The microbiological quality of urban run-off from various large urban developments in the Free State Province, South Africa, has been investigated to establish the extent of faecal pollution. Sanitation of a low socio-economic urban residential development was generally limited, comprising mainly pit and bucket latrines. Sanitation of the other developments was typical of the larger more developed South African urban situation. It comprised well developed residential structures with full water-borne sewerage, fully serviced central business districts, developing residential areas with both waterborne sewerage and additional areas of informal settlement with limited facilities. Faecal coliforms (FC) and enterococci (FE) were used as generalised indicator organisms of faecal pollution together with sorbitol-fermenting bifidobacteria (SFB) and Streptococcus bovis (SB). Somatic (SC) and male specific coliphages (MSC) were used as indicators of organic and sewage pollution of the receiving water in the target areas. Samples were collected from perennial flow during the dry season and from stormwater run-off after thundershowers. Stormwater run-off from the large settlement with limited facilities as well as from the residential development with additional informal settlement reached FC counts of <6 logs/100mL, equivalent to many sewage effluents. Stormwater run-off from well developed urban structures reached FC of <4 logs/100mL, which exceeded safety margins in guidelines for recreational water quality. The results show that run-off from developing urban settlements, as well as developed urban structures, constitute a major source of pollution for a river catchment which is downstream used as a source of water for human consumption and recreation. The level of pollution dictates that stabilisation of urban surface run-off should be regarded as an equal priority to the enforced stabilisation of other wastewaters generated by human activities.},

Fecal coliform concentrations and stream flow were monitored at several points throughout the watershed during an eight-month period (May to December, 2001). Thomas Brook was seriously degraded with respect to microbial water quality. Fecal coliform levels frequently exceeded recreational water quality guidelines. At the watershed outlet, 94{\%} of the collected samples exceeded the recreational water quality guideline during low flow conditions. Substantial bacterial loading was observed along stream reaches impacted by livestock operations. Bacterial loading was also observed along a stream reach that was not impacted by agricultural activities. A dense clustering of residences, using on-site septic systems, was the suspected source. Results from this study indicate the presence of a reservoir of fecal microorganisms within the stream sediments. The release of fecal microorganisms from the stream sediments to the water column during both low and high flow conditions could be a major source of bacterial loading.},

This study has illustrated that enteric bacteria can survive in bed sediments for up 6 wk and that inactivation of the tracer bacteria resembled typical first-order decay. Critical conditionsfor resuspension, as well as resuspension rates, of sediment-associated bacteria were determined for several storm events. The critical shear stress for E. coli NAR resuspension in Swan Creek ranged from 1.5 to 1.7 N m2, which is comparable with literature values for critical shear stresses for erosion of cohesive sediments. Bacteria resuspension was primarily limited to the rising limb of storm hydrographs implying that a finite supply of sediment-associated bacteria are available for resuspension during individual storm events.

C. parvum oocysts were stored in sterile water for 9 months at 15 $C. A sample was removed monthly and analyzed by five different assays to determine oocyst viability. Mouse infection and cell culture showed that C. parvum oocysts remained viable and infectious when stored for 7 months at this temperature. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using probes directed to ribosomal RNA was also applied to these oocysts. The proportion of FISH-positive oocysts was 70--80% for the first 2 months of storage, decreased and remained nearly constant at 40--50% for 3--7 months, then decreased to 20% by 8 months, and to 0% by 9 months. Amylopectin content and mRNA for amyloglucosidase (CPAG), as measured by RT-PCR, decreased much more rapidly. By 3 months and for the remainder of the incubation period, amylopectin content was 20% of the original amount present in the oocysts. The CPAG RT-PCR signal at 3 months was 50% of that observed after 1 month storage, 20% at 4 months, and was not detected thereafter. Thus, results from cell culture and mouse infection assay exhibited the best agreement, the FISH assay showed modest agreement with these assays, and CPAG RT-PCR and the amylopectin assay displayed marginal agreement with the other three assays.},

	annote = {Microbial source tracking to distinguish between human, livestock and wildlife fecal pollution using molecular techniques is a rapidly evolving approach in many developed countries, but has not previously been applied on the African continent. DNA extracts from cow, donkey, and human fecal specimens and raw domestic sewage samples collected in Kenya were tested against five existing quantitative PCR assays designed to detect universal (2), human-specific (2), and cow-specific (1) fecal Bacteroidales genetic markers. Water samples from the River Njoro in Kenya were evaluated using the five tested Bacteroidales markers and a multi-species assay for Cryptosporidium in a preliminary exploration of fecal pollution sources and health risks in this watershed. Diagnostic sensitivity on the validation set varied from 18 to 100{\%} for the five assays while diagnostic specificity was 100{\%}.

Testing of 18 water samples indicates cows are a likely predominant source of fecal contamination in the Njoro Watershed (78{\%} prevailing rate). Probabilistic assessment of human assay results indicates at most three of the river water samples contained human Bacteroidales. Cryptosporidium spp. markers were detected in samples from nine of the 12 sampling locations. Evidence suggesting widespread contamination by cow feces and Cryptosporidium in the Njoro watershed raises serious concerns for human and animal health.},

However, the source of the contamination and the possible presence of pathogens has not been adequately addressed. In this preliminary study, nine major rivers located in the Lower Peninsula of Michigan were investigated for the presence of fecal coliforms, Escherichia coli, enterococci, coliphage, and enteric viruses. Five sites (56%) exceeded the allowable limits set for recreational waters based on E. coli concentrations for the State of Michigan. Three (33%) of these sites (Grand, Kalamazoo, and Rouge rivers) tested positive for the presence of viable enteric viruses. The presence of enteric viruses and elevated levels of microbial indicators suggest that these waters may pose a threat to the health of individuals using them for recreational activities. Several new genotypic and phenotypic characterization methods have emerged that have the ability to define human and animal sources of fecal indicators. Previously, we developed a host-associated molecular marker for Enterococcus faecium, which is human specific and targets the sequence for the enterococcal surface protein (esp). When the nine rivers were screened for the marker, two (Grand and Rouge rivers) were found to be positive, implying the presence of human fecal contamination. This study suggests a preliminary approach for validating the use of molecular markers for identifying sources of fecal pollution in the Great Lakes Region and the human health risks associated with pathogenic viruses.},

The package computes time series and frequency distributions for E. coli, the indicator organism for bathing water quality. Point sources of pollution from combined sewer overflows (CSO) are computed from historical rain series and the existing MOUSE-package (Modelling Of Urban Sewers). Pollution from dry weather flow (DWF) (eg. purification plants) is also included. The bathing water model is based on time series for flow, dispersion and decay and is calibrated from measured frequency distributions in 4 stations within the period 1981-1986. A standard deviation factor STD(E) = 2.4 is achieved inbetween measured and computed distributions. Rest fit values are obtained for 1) scaling factors e(R) and e(S) for pollution from CSO and DWF respectively, 2) diffuse (non-point) E. coli pollution E(D) and 3) dispersion parameters C(b1) and C(b2) in the direction of coastline and vertical hereto. The calibrated model has revealed that an area of 102 ha along the beach exceeds the statistically acceptable quality line for bathing water. The paper presents 4 proposals for improving the quality by reducing the pollution from CSO and DWF, and/or by using an outfall pipe further into the sea for CSO.},

Members of this bacterial order have been widely employed as human and bovine host-specific markers of fecal pollution; however, few studies have focused on gulls, which can be a major source of fecal indicator bacteria and pathogens at beaches. We found a low but consistent occurrence of Bacteroidales in gulls at five beaches in three different counties spanning the Wisconsin shoreline of Lake Michigan. The percentages of gulls positive for Bacteroidales were 4 to 8{\%} at beaches in the southern part of the state and 8 to 50{\%} at beaches in the north. Sequencing of 931 clones from seven gull Bacteroidales 16S rRNA gene libraries revealed a large amount of diversity in both individual and pooled gull fecal samples. Two libraries constructed from pooled gull fecal samples (n = 5 and n = 6) did not have a greater richness of sequences than individual s! amples, suggesting that even within a single gull diversity is high and an extensive sequencing effort is needed to characterize the populations. Estimates of the numbers of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) for the libraries obtained using different similarity levels revealed a large amount of microdiveristy with a limited number of OTUs at the 95% similarity level. Gull sequences were clustered by the beach from which they were collected, suggesting that there were geographic effects on the distribution of Bacteriodales. More than 53% of the 16S rRNA gene sequences from gulls at the southern beaches were associated with the family Porphyromonadaceae, primarily the genus Parabacteroides, whereas sequences from gulls at the northern beaches were comprised of Bacteroidaceae and Prevotellaceae sequences. Comparison of gull sequences with sequences from goose, canine, raccoon, and sewage sources revealed distinct clusters of closely related gull sequences; however, these sequ! ences were widely dispersed across a dendrogram that included ! all other sources, including previously characterized gull Bacteroidales from other studies, suggesting that geographic influence or simply sample representation plays a greater role in the observed population structure than strictly the host gut environment.},

In this study we examine the abundance and distribution of V. cholerae in recreational beach waters and tributaries of Southern California. Water samples were taken from 11 beach locations adjacent to freshwater runoff sources between February 8th and March 1st, 1999. Water samples were also taken from rivers, creeks and coastal wetlands along the Southern California coast between May 19th and June 28th, 1999. In addition to the detection of V. cholerae, environmental parameters including temperature, salinity, coliphage counts, viable heterotrophic plate counts and total bacterial direct counts were also determined to understand the relationships between the presence of V. cholerae and environmental conditions. A direct colony hybridization method using an oligonucleotide probe specific for the 16S-23S intergenic spacer region of V. cholerae, detected V. cholerae in 3 of the 11 beach samples with the highest concentration (60.9 per liter) at the mouth of Malibu Lagoon. V. cholerae and coliphage were not correlated for beach samples, indicating that the presence of V. cholerae is independent of sewage pollution. V. cholerae were detected in all samples taken from rivers, creeks and wetlands of coastal Southern California where salinities were between 1 to 34 parts per thousand (ppt), but was not found at a freshwater sampling site in upper San Juan Creek. The highest density of V. cholerae was found in San Diego Creek with a concentration of 4.25 ×105 CFU/L. The geographical distribution of V. cholerae was inversely correlated with salinity. High concentrations of V. cholerae were more frequently detected in waters with lower (but above 0) salinity. The results of this study provide insight into the ecology of this aquatic species and are potentially important to the understanding of the epidemiology of cholera on a global scale.},

Fifty-seven water samples collected over summer 2002 were analyzed for human adenovirus and enterovirus. Enterococci and E. coli were isolated for antibiotic resistance analysis (ARA) and for PCR identification of human- and animal-specific toxin genes, respectively. All water samples were PCR negative for human enteroviruses and E. coli human-specific toxin gene. E. coli toxin markers revealed the presence of toxin genes specific to bird, rabbit, and cow. Enterococci ARA results supported this conclusion and indicated that fecal bacteria from bird and wild animal feces as well as soil were the predominant source found in the watershed. An E. coli, isolated from the watershed and inoculated back into the heat-sterilized storm drain water, increased 4 log units within 6 days. Collectively, these results suggest that bird and wild animal feces, soil amendments, and/or fecal coliform growth in the storm drain are the major contributors to the fecal bacterial pollution in downstream areas. However, human adenoviruses were detected on two occasions. Fecal bacterial concentrations were not elevated on these two occasions, suggesting that the elevated levels of fecal indicator bacteria in this small watershed could be unrelated to the source of human adenovirus.},

Indicator organisms in lake water under dry weather conditions, in storm water runoff (prior to dilution with lake water), and in the outfall plume within the lake following storm events were monitored and quantified. Results indicated that drainage canals constitute a significant microbial loading to lake waters. Significant reductions of indicator microbes are observed in the water column following two to three days after storm pumping events into the lake. A mathematical model incorporating advection, dispersion, and bacterial die-off gives fairly good prediction on E. coli, enterococcoi, and fecal coliform titers. The somewhat under estimation by model suggests re-suspension of sediment and re-introduction of the indicator organisms that attached to the sediment back into the water column. Future direction of model development should include the mechanism of re-suspension and survival of indicator organisms in sediment.},

The possibility to observe various ocean parameters and processes by existing satellite sensors, such as optical instruments, infrared radiometers, passive microwave radiometers, and active microwave systems (altimeter, scatterometer, SAR) is discussed. The basic parameters are: Sea-surface temperature observed by infrared radiometers, ocean colour by spectrometers, sea-surface elevation by altimeters, and surface roughness by active and passive microwave systems, which can be used to derive surface wind and waves. A number of ocean processes can be derived from synoptic mapping of the basic parameters of larger sea areas, such as current patterns, fronts, eddies, water mass distribution, and various water quality parameters (chlorophyll, surface slicks, suspended sediments). The suitability of existing satellite data to fulfil the operational requirements for temporal and spatial coverage, data delivery in near-real-time, and long-term access to data is discussed in light of the fact that optical/infrared data in northern Europe are severely hampered by frequent cloud cover, while microwave techniques can provide useful data independent of weather and light conditions. Finally, the use of data assimilation in oceanographic models is briefly summarised, indicating that this technique is under development and will soon be adopted in operational oceanography.

Simulated reduction in the risk of illness by reduced faecal loading was multiplied by a willingness to pay for risk reduction to estimate the annual benefits of mitigation. Health benefits of reducing loading by 75{\%} at Irvine Beach were estimated by a willingness to pay method to be about £276k pa. Estimated annualised costs of diffuse pollution mitigation measures across the catchment were higher (>£1 m), and it is very unlikely that 75{\%} mitigation is achievable with current stocking rates. Further work should explore the influence of uncertainty of model parameters, and use emerging epidemiological information on specific zoonotic pathogens such as E. coli O157 and Cryptosporidium. Other components of the value of clean water should also be included to obtain a complete estimate of the cost:benefit of mitigation. {\copyright}2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Concern over water quality in the basin has been expressed because of high levels of enteric disease indigenous to the region. To address these concerns, we conducted a 2-year study to estimate the prevalence of Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Salmonella spp. in surface water within the basin. This study is the first of its kind to identify E. coli O157:H7 repeatedly in surface water collected from a Canadian watershed. Prevalence of E. coli O157:H7 and Salmonella spp. in water samples was 0.9% (n = 1483) and 6.2% (n = 1429), respectively. While data examined at a regional level show a relationship between high livestock density and high pathogen levels in southern Alberta, statistical analysis of point source data indicates that predicted manure output from bovine, swine, and poultry feeding operations was not directly associated with either Salmonella spp. or E. coli O157:H7 prevalence. However, geography and weather variables, which are likely to influence bacterial runoff, were not considered in this model. We also postulate that variations in time, amount, and frequency of manure application onto agricultural lands may have influenced levels of surface-water contamination with these bacterial pathogens.},

Since these wastes contain large concentrations of faecal micro-organisms, these activities inevitably result in bacterial contamination of the receiving waters. It is therefore surprising that only scanty information of such microbial pollution has previously been available. Recent work has been undertaken to rectify this situation and in response to national decisions. Three situations in the North West have been investigated and reported. Interpretation of the bacteriological results supports previous findings that sewage sludge dumped in Liverpool Bay has little or no effect on the bacterial quality of coastal waters, that the provision of a long sea outfall on the North Wirral peninsula has greatly reduced sewage pollution of the adjacent beach and its waters, and that the quality of bathing waters along the Fylde coast are greatly influenced by the discharge of raw sewage from outfalls along its length and the turbidity of the sea during and after discharging.},

	annote = {The goals of this study were to (i) identify issues that affect the ability of discriminant function analysis (DA) of antimicrobial resistance profiles to differentiate sources of fecal contamination, (ii) test the accuracy of DA from a known-source library of fecal Escherichia coli isolates with isolates from environmental samples, and (iii) apply this DA to classify E. coli from surface water. A repeated cross-sectional study was used to collect fecal and environmental samples from Michigan livestock, wild geese, and surface water for bacterial isolation, identification, and antimicrobial susceptibility testing using disk diffusion for 12 agents chosen for their importance in treating E. coli infections or for their use as animal feed additives. Nonparametric DA was used to classify E. coli by source species individually and by groups according to antimicrobial exposure. A modified backwards model-building approach was applied to create the best decision rules for isolate differentiation with the smallest number of antimicrobial agents. Decision rules were generated from fecal isolates and applied to environmental isolates to determine the effectiveness of DA for identifying sources of contamination. Principal component analysis was applied to describe differences in resistance patterns between species groups. The average rate of correct classification by DA was improved by reducing the numbers of species classifications and antimicrobial agents. DA was able to correctly classify environmental isolates when fewer than four classifications were used. Water sample isolates were classified by livestock type. An evaluation of the performance of DA must take into consideration relative contributions of random chance and the true discriminatory power of the decision rules.},

Five rivers (Aoos, Arachthos, Kalamas, Louros, and Voidomatis) and one lake (Pamvotis Ioannina Lake) in Northwestern Greece were investigated during a 10-month period. Drinking and recreational water (swimming pools) from the area were also examined. Samples were collected from prefixed sampling stations and processed following a modification of standard methods for the microbiological examination of water, as suggested by the APHA/AWWA/WEF. Both Giardia cysts and Cryptosporidium oocysts were isolated from Pamvotis Ioannina Lake (15 positive/27 examined samples). Significantly lower numbers of Cryptosporidium oocysts were detected in Arachthos River (1/5), Voidomatis River (1/5), drinking water (1/7), and pool water samples (1/9). No Giardia cysts were detected, neither in river water, nor in drinking, and pool water samples. The results clearly show that, with the exception of Pamvotis Ioannina Lake, where contamination of high level was observed, natural water sources of the investigated area have low pollution, resulting in low contamination with parasites.},

After ingestion, STEC colonize enterocytes of the large bowel with a characteristic attaching and effacing pathology, which is mediated by components of a type III secretion apparatus encoded by the LEE pathogenicity island. Shiga toxins are translocated from the bowel to the circularoty system and transported by leukocytes to capillary endothelial cells in renal glomeruli and other organs. After binding to the receptor globotriaosylceramide on target cells, the toxin is internalized by receptor-mediated endocytosis and interacts with the subcellular machinery to inhibit protein synthesis. This leads to pathophysiological changes that result in HUS. Specific therapeutic or preventive strategies are presently not available. The recent sequencing of genomes of two epidemic E. coli O157 strains has revealed novel pathogenicity islands which will likely provide new insights into the virulence of these bacteria.},

	annote = {In recent years, considerable investment has been committed to sewerage infrastructure and new sewage treatment plants in the catchment surrounding an estuarine basin along the north-west coast of England. Although this capital investment has resulted in a marked reduction in the input of bacterial loads, relatively high counts of faecal indicator organisms are still being encountered in the coastal receiving waters, and the local bathing waters continue to fail on occasions to comply with the European Community (EC) Bathing Water Directive (1976) mandatory standards. Details are given herein of a comprehensive modelling study aimed at quantifying the impact of various bacterial inputs into the estuary and surrounding coastal waters on the bathing water quality. The model domain includes the coastal area and the entire estuary (namely the Ribble) up to the tidal limits of its tributaries. Faecal coliforms have been used as the main water quality indicator organisms. The numerical model developed for this study combines a depth integrated two-dimensional coastal model and a cross-sectionally integrated one-dimensional river model, and is capable of predicting water surface elevations, velocity fields and faecal coliform concentration distributions across the entire model domain. The hydrodynamic model was calibrated using water level and velocity measurements from three surveys and then validated against measured data from three other surveys. In order to predict the faecal coliform concentration distributions, variable faecal coliform decay rates were used, i.e. different values of decay rates were applied to the coastal and riverine waters, for day- and nighttime, and for wet and dry weather conditions. The maximum and minimum decay rates used were 2.32/day and 0.71/day for the dry and wet weather surveys, respectively. The model was then applied to (i) assess the impact of previous discharge strategies and investigate the effectiveness of future capital investment works and (ii) predict the impact of a range of strategic options, including: the effects of adding UV treatment, constructing storm water storage tanks and incorporating various combined sewer overflow (CSO) discharge scenarios for different weather conditions.

Oocyst viability was measured using the fluorescent dyes 496- diaminidino-2-phenylindole and propidium iodide. Inactivation rates were greater in soils than in water and greater in dry soil than in moist and wet soils. Soil type showed no effect on inactivation. Oocysts subjected to freeze--thaw cycles had inactivation rates not significantly different from those of oocysts subjected to 210 C under static conditions. The results indicated that 99% of oocysts exposed to soils that are frozen at 210 C will become inactivated within 50 days whether or not freeze--thaw cycles occur.},

These include bathing waters, which are regulated using faecal indicator organisms as compliance parameters. Thus, for the first time, European regulators are faced with the control of faecal indicator fluxes from agricultural sources where these impact on bathing water compliance locations. Concurrently, reforms to the European Union (EU) Common Agricultural Policy offer scope for supporting on-farm measures producing environmental benefits through the new 'single farm payments' and the concept of 'cross-compliance'. This paper reports the first UK study involving remedial measures, principally stream bank fencing, designed to reduce faecal indicator fluxes at the catchment scale. Considerable reduction in faecal indicator flux was observed, but this was insufficient to ensure bathing water compliance with either Directive 76/160/EEC standards or new health-evidence-based criteria proposed by WHO and the European Commission. {\copyright}2006 Elsevier Ltd.

	annote = {The European Union Water Framework Directive requires that Management Plans are developed for individual River Basin Districts. From the point of view of faecal indicator organisms (FIOs), there is a critical need for screening tools that can provide a rapid assessment of the likely FIO concentrations and fluxes within catchments under base- and high-flow conditions, and of the balance (`source apportionment') between agriculture- and sewage-derived sources. Accordingly, the present paper reports on: (1) the development of preliminary generic models, using water quality and land cover data from previous UK catchment studies for assessing FIO concentrations, fluxes and source apportionment within catchments during the summer bathing season; (2) the calibration of national land use data, against data previously used in the models; and (3) provisional FIO concentration and source-apportionment assessments for England and Wales. The models clearly highlighted the crucial importance of high-flow conditions for the flux of FIOs within catchments. At high flow, improved grassland (and associated livestock) was the key FIO source; FIO loadings derived from catchments with high proportions of improved grassland were shown to be as high as from urbanised catchments; and in many rural catchments, especially in NW and SW England and Wales, which are important areas of lowland livestock (especially dairy) farming, ≥40{\%} of FIOs was assessed to be derived from agricultural sources. In contrast, under base-flow conditions, when there was little or no runoff from agricultural land, urban (i.e. sewerage-related) sources were assessed to dominate, and even in rural areas the majority of FIOs were attributed to urban sources. The results of the study demonstrate the potential of this type of approach, particularly in light of climate change and the likelihood of more high-flow events, in underpinning informed policy development and prioritisation of investment.},

Later the same month, these were presented and discussed at the 'Green Week' in Brussels alongside the on-going revision of the European Union Bathing Water Directive 76/160/EEC. The WHO Guidelines cover general aspects of recreational water management as well as define water quality criteria for various hazards. For faecal pollution, these include faecal indicator organism concentrations and an assessment of vulnerability to faecal contamination. Central to the approach set out in the WHO Guidelines are: (i) the concept of beach profiling to produce a 'sanitary inspection category' which implies a priori hazard assessment as a core management tool and (ii) the prediction of poor water quality to assist in real time risk assessment and public health protection. These management approaches reflect a harmonized approach towards the assessment and management of risk for water-related infectious disease being applied by WHO. Numerical microbiological criteria for intestinal enterococci are proposed in the new Guidelines. These were developed using a novel approach to disease burden assessment, which has been applied to both recreational waters and urban air quality. This paper explains the scientific rationale and mathematical basis of the new approach, which is not presented in the WHO Guidelines for recreational waters. {\copyright}2004 Elsevier Ltd.

	annote = {Characterisation of faecal indicator organism (FIO) concentrations and export coefficients for catchments with particular combinations of land use and under specific climatic regimes is critical in developing models to predict daily loads and apportion sources of the microbial parameters used to regulate water quality. Accordingly, this paper presents a synthesis of FIO concentration and export coefficient data for the summer bathing season, with some comparative winter data, for 205 river/stream sampling points widely distributed across mainland UK. In terms of both geometric mean (GM) FIO concentrations and export coefficients (expressed as cfu km-2 h-1), the results reveal (1) statistically significant elevations at high flow compared with base flow, with concentrations typically increasing by more than an order of magnitude and export coefficients by about two orders; (2) significantly higher values in summer than in winter under high-flow conditions; and (3) extremely wide variability between the catchments (e.g. four orders of magnitude range for GM faecal coliform concentrations), which closely reflects land use-with urban areas and improved pastures identified as key FIO sources. Generally, these two most polluting land uses are concentrated in lowland areas where runoff (m3 km-2 h-1) is low compared with upland areas, which in the UK are dominated by rough grazing and forestry. Consequently, contrasts in export coefficients between land use types are less than for FIO concentrations. The GMs reported for most land use categories are based on ≥13 sites and exhibit quite narrow confidence intervals. They may therefore be applied with some confidence to other catchments in the UK and similar geographical regions elsewhere. Examples are presented to illustrate how the results can be used to estimate daily summer base- and high-flow FIO loads for catchments with different land use types, and to assess the likely effectiveness of certain strategies for reducing FIO pollutant loadings in areas with extensive areas of lowland improved pasture. {\copyright}2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Data are required on point and diffuse source loadings, fate and transport of these non-conservative parameters, on the land surface, within soil systems, in groundwater, streams, impoundments and nearshore waters. This new information is needed by regulators to inform Total Maximum Daily Load estimates in the USA and Programmes of Measures in Europe both designed to prevent impairment of water quality at locations where compliance is assessed against health-based standards for drinking, bathing or shellfish harvesting. In the UK, the majority of catchment-scale activity in this field has been undertaken by physical geographers although microbial flux analysis and modelling has received much less attention from the research and policy communities than, for example, the nutrient parameters. This paper charts the policy drivers now operative and assesses the evidence base to support current policy questions. Finally, gaps and priority research questions are identified.},

Epidemiological studies are required to assess any health risk in using polluted bathing waters and in order to establish the degree of public health risk in using sewage polluted water, and the relationship and correlation with microbial standards and indicator bacteria or viruses. The implementation of the EC Directive 76/160/EEC has provided numerical values for nineteen water quality parameters, principally microbiological parameters. Compliance assessment in the UK is performed using total and fecal coliforms, despite the inclusion of salmonella and viruses in the Directive. The designers of marine outfalls began to incorporate the mandatory coliform levels for coastal waters into their design parameters. The use of predictive modelling provided a mechanism for evaluating potential outfall configurations with a principal objective being compliance with the fecal coliforms criteria of 2000/100 ml. In the absence of other criteria, designers continue with the EC Directive Standards as a basis for performance. The costs of constructing environmentally acceptable discharge systems to the marine environment are considerable, for example the costs of construction of a 5 km outfall, serving a resident population of 250,000, taking into account sewage works and a facility for storage of proportion of storm flows has been estimated at 55.2 million pounds. Quality controlled microbial analysis must be established so that data may be readily compared and used to survey and control sewage discharges and traditional and novel means of treatment.

Understanding the survival characteristics of these organisms in nearshore waters is central to public health protection using robust modelling to effect real-time prediction of water quality at recreation sites as recently suggested by WHO and the Commission of the European Communities Previous models have more often focused on the coliform parameters and assumed two static day-time and night-time T90 values to characterise the decay process. The principal driver for enterococci survival is the received dose of irradiance from sunlight. In the water column, transmission of irradiance is determined by turbidity produced by suspended material. This paper reports the results of irradiated microcosm experiments using simulated sunlight to investigate the decay of intestinal enterococci in relatively turbid estuarine and coastal waters collected from the Severn Estuary and Bristol Channel, UK. High-turbidity estuarine waters produced a T90 value of 39.5 h. Low-turbidity coastal waters produced a much shorter T90 value of 6.6 h. In experiments receiving no irradiation, high-turbidity estuarine waters also produced a longer T90 of 65.1 h compared with corresponding low-turbidity coastal waters, T90 24.8 h. Irradiated T90 values were correlated with salinity, turbidity and suspended solids (r>0.8, p200 NTU is similar to decay observed under dark conditions. Most significantly, these results suggest that modelling turbidity and or suspended solids offers a potential means of predicting T90 values in 'real-time' for discrete cells of a hydrodynamic model. {\copyright}2004 Elsevier Ltd.

The study which has generated the data for this paper was initiated to quantify 'catchment-derived' fluxes of faecal indicators originating from both point and diffuse sources to inform the competent authorities on the potential for, and prioritization of, further options for reducing the faecal indicator loadings to this crucial coastal environment. It represents the first UK drainage basin-scale 'profile' of faecal indicator sources as recommended by WHO {$[$}1999.

This paper focuses on the relationships between land use and faecal indicator organism concentrations in surface waters within this very large drainage basin (1583 km2) containing some extensive urban areas. A geographical information system comprising readily available digital elevation, remotely sensed land cover and digital map data was used to generate the land use variables for subcatchments draining to 41 locations across the study area. Presumptive concentrations of coliforms, Escherichia coli and enterococci (colony forming unit (cfu) 100 ml-1) were measured at each location on at least 20 occasions over a 44-day period within the 2002 bathing season. The sampling programme targeted hydrograph events. Hydrometric records were used to allocate results as either base flow or high flow. At each site, geometric mean faecal indicator organism concentrations were significantly elevated at high flow compared to base flow. Stepwise regression modelling produced statistically significant models predicting geometric mean base and high-flow faecal indicator organism concentrations from land use variables (r2: 49.5-68.1{\%}). The dominant predictor variable in each case was the proportion of built-up land in subcatchments, suggesting that this land use type, with associated sewage-related inputs, is a critical source of faecal indicator organisms in this drainage basin. {\copyright}2005 Elsevier Ltd.

The beaches were situated at various distances from the three major shoreline ocean outfalls discharging primary effluent. The samples were tested for faecal coliform and faecal streptococci indicator bacteria. The same samples were also analysed for natural fluorescence. Excitation wavelength used was 280 nm and fluorescence emission from seawater effluent mixtures was observed at 445 nm. Indicator bacteria densities correlated well with fluorescence intensities for beach monitoring stations north of Sydney Harbour. Best correlations were observed for the stations situated within 5 kilometres from the outfall. Indicator bacteria densities were not as well correlated with fluorescence intensities for the stations south of Sydney Harbour. However, similar emission spectra were observed for all samples collected from stations both north and south of Sydney Harbour. Nevertheless, indicator bacteria densities for southern stations were observed to be better correlated with fluorescence intensities on particular days. The stations north of Sydney Harbour are believed to be impacted only by the one outfall at North Head. However the system south of Sydney Harbour is more complex. The southern stations are known to be impacted by any, or all of the three major outfalls at Bondi, Malabar, and North Head. Fluorescence can be used to determine effluent concentration in ocean waters where the origin of the effluent is known. There should also be opportunities for the development of fluorescence as an alternative indicator for 'real time' public health monitoring of recreational waters.},

	annote = {Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and regression modeling techniques were used to evaluate relationships between land use and fecal pollution in Murrells Inlet, a small, urbanized, high-salinity estuary located between Myrtle Beach and Georgetown, SC. GIS techniques were used to identify and calculate land use and spatial variables to be used in a regression model. The regression analysis was performed to identify specific land-use characteristics that may influence fecal coliform densities in the estuary. The regression modeling used land-use parameters to explain the variability of fecal coliform densities measured monthly at 21 locations in the estuary over the 10-year period from 1989 to 1998. Individual regression models were generated for each season, and for a combined data set. The results of the regression analyses indicate that proximity to areas with septic tanks, and rainfall runoff from urbanized areas are important predictors of fecal coliform densities in the estuary. Sampling sites closer to areas with high densities of active septic tanks or more urbanized land uses tended to have higher fecal coliform densities. Although these results may suggest that septic tanks are a substantial human source of fecal pollution, previous research has indicated that the fecal pollution in those areas is probably not from human sources. The areas of Murrells Inlet with higher septic tank densities also are located in areas of high housing density, are in close proximity to the land-water interface, and are in the extreme upper reaches of the estuary, where flushing and dilution effects may be reduced. The higher fecal coliform densities observed at these locations may be a coincidental result of these factors and fecal deposition from pets, and not the direct result of fecal pollution input from the septic tanks. The results also show seasonal differences in the dynamics of fecal coliform bacterial pollution in the estuary. The winter model included a rainfall interaction term, which indicates that ground saturation effects may be an important part of fecal deposition in winter months. The water quality management implications of this research include identification of strategies to reduce or intercept urban stormwater runoff, reduction of waste dumping from boats, and reduction of pet waste. {\copyright}2003 Elsevier B.V.

MAR analysis was performed to identify areas in the estuary that are impacted by human-source fecal pollution. Additionally, regression analysis was performed to determine if an association exists between land use and fecal coliform densities over the ten-year period from 1989 to 1998. Land-use variables were derived using Geographic Information System (GIS) techniques and were used in the regression analysis. MAR analyses were conducted by comparing the frequency and patterns of antibiotic resistance found in Escherichia coli isolates derived from surface water samples and from sewage sources in the Murrells Inlet sewage collection system. The MAR results suggest that the majority of the fecal pollution detected in the Murrells Inlet estuary may be from non-human sources, including fecal coliforms isolated from areas in close proximity to high densities of active septic tanks. A MAR Index, which measures the frequency of antibiotic resistance, was calculated for each of twenty-three water samples and nine sewage samples. The antibiotic resistance pattern comparisons were performed using cluster analysis. Although the MAR indices indicated that several surface water sites had potential human-source contamination, the cluster analysis suggests that only one sampling site had MAR patterns that were similar to those found in the sewage samples. This site was in close proximity to several large pleasure boats as well as a sewage collection system lift station, but was not near areas with active septic tanks. The results of the regression analysis also suggest that sewage sources and rainfall runoff from urbanized areas may contribute to fecal pollution in the estuary.},

A standard curve was developed based on the PCR protocol with a minimum quantification limit of 10 cell equivalents ml-1 achieved using an autoclaved water sample from recreational water spiked with known quantities of an Aeromonas ATCC strain. The Q-PCR protocol was validated and applied to detect and quantify the total number of aeromonads in water samples collected from two fresh water beaches on Lake Ontario. The Q-PCR protocol revealed significantly higher numbers of aeromonads in all water samples than a culture-based assay at both beaches. Foreshore sand was found to serve as a reservoir of high concentrations of Aeromonas similar to this phenomenon noted for enteric bacteria like Eschershia coli. The new real-time Q-PCR protocol facilitated the rapid quantification of total numbers of Aeromonas cells present in recreational water samples in <3 hours without culturing.},

This article investigates the variation of fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) concentrations in the surf zone and the adjacent coastal marsh by applying autocorrelation and cross-correlation analyses that illustrate solar and tidal modulations. A steady state bioreactor model was developed to explain solar inactivation in the surf zone, whereas a dynamic model was applied to explain tidally influenced disturbances in the coastal marsh. These models applied to intensive monitoring datasets on FIB and environmental variables have provided insights into the biologic and physical processes controlling coastal water quality, specifically the influence of sunlight and tides on bacterial levels. {\copyright}2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

The assays were developed for the detection and enumeration of non-point source input of fecal pollution to watersheds. The quantitative ``universal''Bacteroidales assay BacUni-UCD detected all tested stool samples from human volunteers (18 out of 18), cat (7 out of 7), dog (8 out of 8), seagull (10/10), cow (8/8), horse (8/8), and wastewater effluent (14/14). The human assay BacHum-UCD discriminated fully between human and cow stool samples but did not detect all stool samples from human volunteers (12/18). In addition, there was 12.5{\%} detection of dog stool (1/8), but no cross-reactivity with cat, horse, or seagull fecal samples. In contrast, all wastewater samples were positive for the BacHum-UCD marker, supporting its designation as 100{\%} sensitive for mixed-human source identification. The cow-specific assay BacCow-UCD fully discriminated between cow and human stool samples. There was 38{\%} detection of horse stool (3/8), but no cross-specificity with any of the other animal stool samples tested. The dog assay BacCan-UCD discriminated fully between dog and cow stool or seagull guano samples and detected 62.5{\%} stool samples from dogs (5/8). There was some cross-reactivity with 22.2{\%} detection of human stool (4/18), 14.3{\%} detection of cat stool (1/7), and 28.6{\%} detection of wastewater samples (4/14). After validation using stool samples, single-blind tests were used to further demonstrate the efficacy of the developed markers; all assays were sensitive, reproducible, and accurate in the quantification of mixed fecal sources present in aqueous samples. Finally, the new assays were compared with previously published sequences, which showed the new methodologies to be more specific and sensitive. Using Bayes'Theorem, we calculated the conditional probability that the four assays would correctly identify general and host-specific fecal pollution in a specific watershed in California for which 73 water samples had been analyzed. Such an approach allows for a direct comparison of the efficacy of different MST methods, including those based on library-dependent methodologies. For the universal marker BacUni-UCD, the probability that fecal pollution is present when the marker is detected was 1.00; the probability that host-specific pollution is present was 0.98, 0.84, and 0.89 for the human assay HF160F, the cow assay BacCow-UCD, and the dog assay BacCan-UCD, respectively. The application of these markers should provide meaningful information to assist with efforts to identify and control sources of fecal pollution to impaired watersheds.},

The model incorporates an analog of the Damk{\"o}hler number, referred here as a dimensionless number K that indicates whether transport or inactivation is controlling the surf zone pollution. The model successfully explains key feature of fate and transport of FIB in the surf zone as revealed by recent studies in 2000.

Analysis of historical shoreline monitoring data from Huntington Beach, southern California, reveals that protocols used to decide whether to post a sign are prone to error. Errors in public notification (referred to here as posting errors) originate from the variable character of pollutant concentrations in the ocean, the relatively infrequent sampling schedule adopted by most monitoring programs (daily to weekly), and the intrinsic error associated with binary advisories in which the public is either warned or not. In this paper, we derive a probabilistic framework for estimating posting error rates, which at Huntington Beach range from 0 to 41{\%}, and show that relatively high sample-to-sample correlations (>0.4) are required to significantly reduce binary advisory posting. errors. Public mis-notification of coastal water quality can be reduced by utilizing probabilistic approaches for predicting current coastal water quality, and adopting analog, instead of binary, warning systems.},

	annote = {Swimmers' dermatitides occuring in natural - accordingly polluted - waters are most probably of chemical nature. In clean waters, however, they are primarily caused by larvae of duck-flukes, the so called cercariae (Fig. 2). In a natural pool near Biberach (Fig. 5) undetermined cases of swimmers' dermatitis have appeared. Hence a cercarial dermatitis was suspected and specific examinations were carried out. At the biological examination of the pool, many watersnails of the species Radix ovata have been found near the shore. Out of 180 collected snails 8 produced cercariae of different trematode species (Fig. 6). Hence an infective cycle between duck and snail could be ascertained here. However, the special cercariae, producing dermatitis (Fig. 3, 4), could not be found. Having taken that into account the author was standing in the snail biotop without protective clothes for about 1 hour to provoke cercarial dermatitis. A few minutes later the corresponding clinical picture with an extremely strong itching developed. Papules were to be seen 12 h later (Fig. 7, 8), the symptoms lasted 2 weeks altogether. By different serological methods (Cercarienhuellenreaction) (Fig. 9) indirect immunofluorescent test with complete cercariae (Fig. 10) and cercarial sections (Fig. 11) antibodies against cercariae could be demonstrated in the serum of the author 14 days later. As a therapy only the symptomatic treatment of the itching is possible. In principle etiologic measures against cercarial dermatitides are possible by chemical snail control. But as a rule this is to be refused because of the severe ecological damages. However, in case of swimmers' dermatitis it is nonetheless indispensible to clarify eventual parasitogenic reasons because of the specific hygienic consequences.},

Environmental Protection Agency-approved method for enterococci (Method 1600) in recreational water is a membrane filter (MF) method that takes 24 hours to obtain results. If the recreational water is not in compliance with the standard, the risk of exposure to enteric pathogens may occur before the water is identified as hazardous. Because flow cytometry combined with specific fluorescent antibodies has the potential to be used as a rapid detection method for microorganisms, this technology was evaluated as a rapid, same-day method to detect enterococci in bathing beach waters. The flow cytometer chosen for this study was a laser microbial detection system designed to detect labeled antibodies. A comparison of MF counts with flow cytometry counts of enterococci in phosphate buffer and sterile-filtered recreational water showed good agreement between the two methods. However, when flow cytometry was used, the counts were several orders of magnitude higher than the MF counts with no correlation to Enterococcus spike concentrations. The unspiked sample controls frequently had higher counts than the samples spiked with enterococci. Particles within the spiked water samples were probably counted as target cells by the flow cytometer because of autofluorescence or non-specific adsorption of antibody and carryover to subsequent samples. For these reasons, this technology may not be suitable for enterococci detection in recreational waters. Improvements in research and instrument design that will eliminate high background and carryover may make this a viable technology in the future. {\copyright}IWA Publishing 2007.},

	journal = {Can. J. Microbiol.},
	annote = {Ring-billed (Larus delawarensis Ord, 1815) and herring (Larus argentatus Pontoppidan, 1763) gulls are predominant species of shorebirds in coastal areas. Gulls contribute to the fecal indicator burden in beach sands, which, once transported to bathing waters, may result in water quality failures. The importance of these contamination sources must not be overlooked when considering the impact of poor bathing water quality on human health. This study examined the occurrence of human enteric pathogens in gull populations at Racine, Wisconsin. For 12 weeks in 2004 and 2005, and 7 weeks in 2006, 724 gull fecal samples were examined for pathogen occurrence on traditional selective media (BBL CHROMagar-Salmonella, Remel Campy-BAP, 7{\%} horse blood agar) or through the use of novel isolation techniques (Campylobacter, EC FP5-funded CAMPYCHECK Project), and confirmed using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for pathogens commonly harbored in gulls. An additional 226 gull fecal samples, collected in the same 12-week period in 2004, from a beach in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, were evaluated with standard microbiological methods and PCR. Five isolates of Salmonella (0.7{\%}), 162 (22.7{\%}) isolates of Campylobacter, 3 isolates of Aeromonas hydrophila group 2 (0.4{\%}), and 28 isolates of Plesiomonas shigelloides (3.9{\%}) were noted from the Racine beach. No occurrences of Salmonella and 3 isolates of Campylobacter (0.4{\%}) were found at the Milwaukee beach. A subset of the 2004 samples was also examined for Giardia and Cryptosporidium and was found to be negative. Information as to the occurrence of human pathogens in beach ecosystems is essential to design further studies assessing human health risk and to determine the parameters influencing the fate and transport of pathogens in the nearshore environment.

Implementation of an appropriate monitoring program can, under some circumstances, be expensive. This study explored the use of composite sampling at two Racine, Wisconsin beaches over a four month period (n = 68 days) to determine whether compositing can provide a valid, unbiased, and cost-effective measure of water quality. Multiple point sampling occurred throughout the bathing season, with water samples collected daily from three or four fixed locations along each beach. From each individual sample, well-mixed aliquots were combined to form a composite sample. Individual and composite samples were assayed identically for Escherichia coli using Colilert-18 and Quanti-Tray 2000 (IDEXX Laboratories, Inc., Westbrook, ME). Results from this study indicate a reasonable expectation of a simple 1:1 ratio between the composite samples and the arithmetic mean of the individual samples. Additionally, log variance of the composite sample results did not differ significantly from that of the single sample averages (p > 0.2). Empirical values for log standard deviations varied by no more than 7{\%} between the composite sample and individually assayed samples. Thus compositing, as performed in this study, appears to introduce neither significant bias nor additional variability into the monitoring results and stands as a reasonable alternative to data sets derived from single-sample methods. Regulatory programs adopting this approach could maintain sample integrity while reducing costs associated with recreational water quality assessment.},

	annote = {The Great Lakes region possesses over 10,000 miles of shoreline (US EPA and Government of Canada, 1995) which are home to over 1,000 beaches. These beaches represent a recreational outlet for over 30 million people (US EPA and Government of Canada, 1995) and yet many of them remain inaccessible for periods of time each bathing season due to water quality advisories. The reason for these advisories is often elusive to beach managers, hence impeding their ability to craft appropriate mitigation measures. Even when the sources of contamination are known, remediation measures may not be put into practice due to the perception that they are too costly. However, a recent study has demonstrated that investing in environmental improvements which increase the number of days available for swimming in the Great Lakes region by 20% would generate $2--$3 billion dollars in direct economic effects. Therefore, while beach closings and advisories continue to rise overall, some Great Lakes communities have recognized the potential for municipal beaches to generate revenue and increase the quality of life for their citizens and have undertaken comprehensive studies to improve recreational water quality. In Racine, Wisconsin, USA, research conducted to identify pollution sources guided the development of better beach management practices such as ecologically appropriate beach modifications, improved mechanical beach grooming strategies, and the redesign of a major storm water outlet (including installation of a constructed wetland area). Resulting improvements have reduced bathing water quality advisories from 66% of days during the swimming season in 2000 to 5% or less in four consecutive years (2005--2008). These improvements to Racine beaches facilitated Blue Wave certification from the Clean Beaches Council (Washington, DC); thereby restoring public confidence, increasing beach use by the residents and tourists, and expanding the role of the beachfront in the local economy.},

Constant wave action may serve as a transport mechanism for delivering bacterial organisms to surface waters resulting in an increased frequency of dry weather advisories. The ability to reduce the concentration of these organisms may serve to improve recreational water quality. To date, few researchers have explored anthropogenic factors affecting the content of Escherichia coli in beach sands. This study explored the influence of mechanical beach grooming on in situ populations of Escherichia coli at a southwestern Lake Michigan beach to determine if an alteration in current beach management practices would serve to reduce the number of dry weather advisories in this community. Preliminary studies conducted during 2001 demonstrated that professional grooming significantly increased Escherichia coli content in beach sands relative to non-groomed or hand raked plots (p < 0.001). This data also suggested that deeper grooming might reduce differences between groomed and non-groomed areas. Subsequently, two mechanical grooming techniques were compared at Racine, WI in 2002: groomed to a depth of 5 to 7 cm with leveling of beach sands and groomed to a depth of 7 to 10 cm without leveling. Escherichia coli content between treatments were significantly correlated (p < 0.009). The density of the bacterium in deeper groomed/unleveled sands was significantly lower in visibly moist or wet but not dry sands (p = 0.038). In 2003, the manner in which beach sands were maintained using the mechanical beach groomer was altered and a follow-up study conducted. A 30 percent reduction in the number of poor water quality advisories due to dry weather events was achieved as a result of these measures. These results demonstrate that mechanical beach grooming may affect Escherichia coli content in beach sands, a potential source of non-point pollution to recreational waters.},

E. coli concentrations were significantly different (p<0.05), when water from different depths was compared. Sampling water at depths of 30, 60, and 120 cm resulted in significantly lower E. coli concentrations as depth increased. Had the State of Wisconsin chosen to collect beach water monitoring samples at a shallower or deeper depth, numbers of beach closures and the potential risk to public health would have changed substantially.

A sensor package is being developed which will fit on small aircraft at a ten-time reduction in operating cost. The sensor package will include a small multispectral camera for water color measurements from which chlorophyll, suspended sediment, and dissolved organic concentrations will be estimated using newly developed algorithms and models. A PRT-5 radiometer will measure surface temperature and a microwave radiometer, which is being reduced in size, will measure water salinity. Deployed with satellite sensors, these airborne sensors will be able to observe tidal, seasonal, annual variations and spatial distributions of phytoplankton blooms, sediment plumes, estuarine fronts, circulation patterns, and other estuarine phenomena. An optical model is briefly described which has been developed for measuring the concentrations of suspended sediment, chloropyll, and dissolved organics in turbid estuarine waters. An airborne instrument package which is being developed to meet the model requirements is discussed.},

The present study sought to identify and track sources of nutrients and FIB to four beaches in Hanalei Bay and one beach outside the bay, together representing a wide range of land uses. 223Ra and 224Ra activity, salinity, nutrient and FIB concentrations were measured in samples from the coastal aquifer, the nearshore ocean, springs, the Hanalei River, and smaller streams. In addition, FIB concentrations in beach sands were measured at each site, and the enterococcal surface protein (esp) gene assay was used to investigate whether the observed FIB originated from a human source. Nutrient concentrations in groundwater were significantly higher than in nearshore water, inversely correlated to salinity, and highly site specific, indicating local controls on groundwater quality. Fluxes of groundwater into Hanalei Bay were calculated using a mass-balance approach and represented at least 2-10{\%} of river discharges. However, submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) may provide 2.7 times as much nitrate+nitrite to Hanalei Bay as does the Hanalei River. It may also provide significant fluxes of phosphate and ammonium, comprising 15{\%} and 20{\%} of Hanalei River inputs, respectively. SGD-derived silica inputs to the bay comprised less than 3{\%} of Hanalei River inputs. FIB concentrations in groundwater were typically lower than those in nearshore water, suggesting that significant FIB inputs from SGD are unlikely. Positive esp gene assays suggested that some enterococci in environmental samples were of human fecal origin. Identifying how nutrients and FIB enter nearshore waters will help environmental managers address pressing water quality issues, including exceedances of the state Enterococcus water quality standard and nutrient loading to coral reefs. {\copyright}2008 Coastal and Estuarine Research Federation.},

However, this increase in tourism may cause pollution of the sea. This can be only avoided by proper planning and by predicting the "carrying capacity" of the coast in terms of sea pollution. This is especially important for developing countries where part of the wastewater is discharged without any treatment into the sea. In the present study the beaches were classified according to their use--and consequently the amount of waste discharged into the sea--into four groups: (1) coasts that are used only for swimming and recreational purposes; (2) coasts used simultaneously for dwelling, swimming, and recreational purposes; (3) coasts along which only dwellings exist; and (4) natural and man-made harbors, i.e., coasts used as shelters. During the survey,40,320 observations were made between December 1985 and February 1988 to determine the effect of the number of tourists on seawater quality. The results obtained were analyzed by a multilinear regression program to obtain an empirical equation giving the extent of the sea pollution in terms of coliform concentration as a function of population density and some other environmental factors. The equations derived in this study enable the determination of the carrying capacity of a beach in terms of pollution as well as the expected degree of pollution corresponding to a given population density. Furthermore, it allows the prediction of the extra carrying capacity that can be obtained by improving the waste-disposal conditions.},

Besides the accommodation facilities discharging the generated wastewater into the sea without any treatment, the summer resorts of the coastal areas also deteriorate the coastal waters. Since most of the summer resorts do not have any sewage system, it is difficult to control these non-point sources. The research was conducted in two phases at selected two beaches and a coastal village having summer resorts in {\c C}e{\c s}me, Turkey. In the first phase, seawater quality was monitored while the wastewater was discharged/seeped into the marine environment without any treatment. In the second phase, besides the construction of the treatment plants for the wastewater of the facilities, willow trees were planted in the soil near the septic tanks of the summer resorts. During the study, the sea quality was monitored by samples collected during the peak seasons as well as during the low seasons to determine the effect of the population increase on the seawater quality. Growth rates of the foliage and trees were also followed up. During both phases of the research, a questionnaire was distributed to the tourists and the local people to determine the types and the number of incidences of the waterborne diseases they faced. The waterborne disease incidence is actually increasing worldwide, promoted by both natural phenomena and human activities including sewage disposal. This study verified that even small increases in the degree of microbial pollution in seawater results to a considerable increase in the number of waterborne disease incidences. This is a very important observation especially for developing countries which depend economically mainly on tourism. In this study, the results indicated that by the operation of the treatment plants and the application of the willows, the seawater quality was improved and the seaborne disease incidences caused by the sewage disposal were reduced significantly. {\copyright}2008.},

	annote = {Research was undertaken to characterize Escherichia coli isolates in interstitial water samples of a sandy beach on the southeastern shore of Lake Huron, Ontario, Canada. A survey of the beach area revealed the highest abundance of E. coli in interstitial water of the foreshore beach sand next to the swash zone. Higher concentrations of E. coli (up to 1.6 ×10 6 CFU/100 ml of water) were observed in the interstitial water from the sampling holes on the beach itself compared to lake water and sediment. Repetitive extragenic palindromic PCR (REP-PCR) was used to characterize the genetic diversity of E. coli isolates from interstitial water samples on the beach. E. coli isolates from the same sampling location frequently exhibited the same REP-PCR pattern or were highly similar to each other. In contrast, E. coli isolates from different sampling locations represented populations distinct from each other. This study has identified a unique ecological niche within the foreshore area of the beach where E. coli may survive and possibly multiply outside of host organisms. The results are of interest as increasing concentrations of E. coli in recreational waters are often considered to be an indication of recent fecal pollution.

Multiplex PCR using the six pairs of primers produced specific amplicons of the expected sizes from mixed populations of reference bacterial strains in seawater and from pure cultures. The m-PCR assay was specific and rapid, with a turnaround time of o12 h. The detection limit of the assay for the bacterial targets was estimated at 100--102 cfu. Multiplex PCR analysis was performed on 19 seawater samples collected around Hong Kong and the results indicated significant levels of four bacterial pathogens at several sites where primary sewage wastes are discharged, and the levels of which showed no correlation with E. coli counts. Overall, both laboratory and field validation results demonstrated that the m-PCR assay developed in this study could provide a cost-effective and informative supplement to conventional microbiological methods for routine monitoring and risk assessment of water quality.},

	annote = {Although Escherichia coli is widely distributed in the marine environment, only a small percentage are pathogenic to humans. Nonetheless, the widespread occurrence of waterborne infections of E. coli origin in humans has become one of the major health problems worldwide. To date, several types of enterovirulent E. coli have been recognized as the aetiologic agents of various gastrointestinal infections in humans. The most commonly encountered are those belonging to the enterotoxigenic (ETEC), enteroinvasive (EIEC), enterohaemorrhagic (EHEC) and enteropathogenic (EPEC) subtypes. In order to better determine the health risks that are associated with exposure to some of these specific subtypes, we have developed a very sensitive multiplex PCR system for the rapid detection and typing of ETEC, EHEC and possibly EPEC strains of E. coli in the aquatic environment. The target genes chosen for this investigation included: the PHO-A housekeeping gene (present in all E. coli); the LT1, LT2 and ST1 genes of ETEC; the VT1 and VT2 verotoxin, and EAE virulence genes of EHEC and EPEC, respectively. Six pairs of oligonucleotide primers were designed to simultaneously amplify internal fragments of these genes by multiplex PCR to generate PCR products that could be analysed and confirmed with relative ease by gel electrophoresis and HincII enzyme digestion. The results showed that the six sets of PCR primers were highly specific for their target genes and produced specific amplimers of the expected size from several control strains of E. coli --ATCC 35401 (LT1+/ST1+); SA53 (LT2+/VT2+); and O157 (VT1+/VT2+/EAE+). The detection sensitivity of the multiplex PCR system for the six target genes in an E. coli cell mixture was optimized and enhanced by preincubating serially diluted cells in Luria-Bertani broth for 6 h prior to PCR analysis. The results obtained indicated a detection sensitivity of 10$\,^{\circ}$CFU (of each strain) per 100 μl reaction. Multiplex PCR analysis of seawater samples collected from four sewage-polluted sites in Hong Kong indicated the presence in all four samples of E. coli bacteria that were positive for LT1, ST1, VT1 and EAE virulence genes. Overall, the data indicated that the multiplex PCR system described in this study is a potentially very useful and powerful method for routine monitoring and risk assessment of water quality.},

	annote = { Aims: Microbial water quality and possible human sources of faecal pollution were assessed in a Florida estuary that serves shellfishing and recreational activities. Methods and Results: Indicator organisms (IO), including faecal coliforms, Escherichia coli and enterococci, were quantified from marine and river waters, sediments and oysters. Florida recreational water standards were infrequently exceeded (6--10% of samples); however, shellfishing standards were more frequently exceeded (28%). IO concentrations in oysters and overlaying waters were significantly correlated, but oyster and sediment IO concentrations were uncorrelated. The human-associated esp gene of Enterococcus faecium was detected in marine and fresh waters at sites with suspected human sewage contamination. Lagrangian drifters, used to determine the pathways of bacterial transport and deposition, suggested that sediment deposition from the Ochlockonee River contributes to frequent detection of esp at a Gulf of Mexico beach. Conclusions: These data indicate that human faecal pollution affects water quality in Wakulla County and that local topography and hydrology play a role in bacterial transport and deposition. Significance and Impact of the Study: A combination of IO enumeration, microbial source tracking methods and regional hydrological study can reliably inform regulatory agencies of IO sources, improving risk assessment and pollution mitigation in impaired waters.},

	annote = {Plesiomonas shigelloides is a ubiquitous waterborne pathogen responsible for diseases such as diarrhea and bacillary dysentery, commonly afflicting infants and children. This bacterium is endowed with an O-antigen gene cluster consisting of 10 consecutive reading frames. One of these, designated wbgU (orf3), has been overexpressed and biochemically characterized to show that it encodes a uridine diphosphate-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) C4 epimerase, only the second microbial enzyme characterized to have this activity. Epimerization is an equilibrium reaction resulting in a 70:30 ratio of UDP-GlcNAc to uridine diphosphate-N-acetylgalactosamine (UDP-GalNAc), irrespective of the initial substrate. The K sub(m) values for UDP-GalNAc and UDP-GlcNAc are 131 mu M and 137 mu M, respectively. WbgU is also capable of converting nonacetylated derivatives but with much lower efficiency. It contains a tightly bound nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide {$[$}NAD(H){$]$} molecule and requires no other cofactors for activity. We propose here that this enzyme catalyzes the first of the three transformations in the biosynthetic pathway of 2-acetamino-2-deoxy-L-altruronic acid, an unusual sugar present in the O-specific side chains of lipopolysaccharide of P. shigelloides O17 and its close relative Escherichia coli Sonnei.},

This study analyzed multiple stormwater samples taken throughout the duration of three separate storms (at two different sites) to evaluate the fraction of microbes partitioning to denser ``settleable'' particles and to examine how partitioning behavior varied over the course of a storm. Intra-storm sampling also allowed for estimates of microbial loading rates (both total and particle-associated) and cumulative storminduced microbial load. Five different indicator organisms were examined, with the fraction of microbes associated with settleable particles assessed via a calibrated centrifugation method. Partitioning behavior varied across microorganism type, with an average of 40% of fecal coliforms, Escherichia coli, and enterococci associating with settleable particles, compared to approximately 65% of Clostridium perfringens spores and only 13% of total coliphage. Partitioning remained fairly constant for each type of organism throughout storm events. Nonetheless, higher concentrations of both settleable particles and microbes entering the water column soon after the onset of a storm led to higher loading rates of settleable microbes in the storm's earliest stages, a trend that could have important implications for the design of stormwater management structures (e.g., detention basins). Estimates of cumulative storm-induced microbial loading suggested that one day's worth of storm loading can be the equivalent of months, or even years, of dry-weather loading.},

This has resulted in degradation of coastal water quality, contamination of the adjoining beaches and seafronts. The Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai has therefore, undertaken the task of delineating appropriate sewage disposal system to achieve cleaner marine ecosystem through marine outfalls at specific locations. This paper presents the results of the mathematical simulations on the impacts of discharge is-a-vis the length of the outfall and level of land treatment apriori. The results of the simulation indicate the level of bacterial pollution to be higher near the diffuser locations as compared to nearshore regions. 48 h simulation result analysis shows that FC counts near the diffuser location will be in the range of 2000-8000 counts per 100 ml.},

First stage results of investigation carried out off the river mouth are presented. The extension of the area influenced by the river has been estimated at 400 km2. Due to the river's high nutrient input rates, eutrophic processes occur with an intensity depending on sample distances from the mouth. Some data concerning the limiting factor have also been derived. Toxicity studies have revealed an incipient threat from Cd and Hg concentration. HCB was only occasionally found in the zone; PCB's were found in surprisingly high levels further away from the river mouth. Bacteriological data led to conclude that the river's impact on beach bathing conditions is only limited to an area immediately adjacent to the two outfalls. With the exception of minor changes due to the eurhyaline nature of the zone, no major variation in receiving area ecology was detected (for benthos and nekton).},

Bird distributions along the beach were determined mainly by habitat type (particularly a lagoon and exposed rocky intertidal areas). For crows and western gulls, there was some evidence that access to urban refuse increased abundance. Interactions between birds and people often caused birds to move or fly away, particularly when people were within 20 m. During a short observation period, 10% of humans and 39% of dogs disturbed birds. More than 70% of birds flew when disturbed. Bird species varied in the frequency that they were disturbed, partially because a few bird species foraged on the upper beach where contact with people was less frequent. Most disturbances occurred low on the beach. Although disturbances caused birds to move away from humans, most displacement was short enough that variation in human activity did not alter large-scale patterns of beach use by the birds. Birds were less reactive to humans (but not dogs) when beach activity was low.},

Regulatory outcomes were also compared based on choice of indicator and method. Positive correlation was seen between QPCR cell equivalents and viable cells through the wastewater treatment process and in all surface water samples (river or freshwater bathing beach) but not in direct stormwater discharge.

The present study applied the esp gene assay to a variety of coastal environments in California and Hawaii, including groundwater, sand, freshwater creeks, estuaries, and the surf zone. Results indicate that enterococci of human origin are present in many of these environments, suggesting that at least a portion of the bacterial pollution at these sites is a result of anthropogenic inputs rather than autochthonous microbial populations.},

The purpose of this study is to devise and test covalently linked antibody--bead complexes for faecal indicator bacteria (FIB), specifically Escherichia coli or Enterococcus spp., in measuring water quality in freshwater and marine systems. Methods and Results: Covalently linked complexes were 58--89% more robust than antibody--bead complexes used in previous studies. Freshwater and marine water samples analysed using covalently linked immunomagnetic separation/adenosine triphosphate quantification technique (Cov-IMS/ATP) and culture-based methods yielded good correlations for E. coli (R = 0·87) and Enterococcus spp. (R = 0·94), with method detection limits below EPA recreational water quality health standards for single standard exceedances (E. coli-- 38 cells per 100 ml; Enterococcus spp. -- 25 cells per 100 ml). Cov-IMS/ATP correctly classified 87% of E. coli and 94% of Enterococcusspp. samples based on these water quality standards. Cov-IMS/ATP was also used as a field method to rapidly distinguish differential loading of E. coli between two stream channels to their confluence. Conclusions: Cov-IMS/ATP is a robust, in-field detection method for determining water quality of both fresh and marine water systems as well as differential loading of FIB from two converging channels. Significance and Impact of the Study: To our knowledge, this is the first work to present a viable rapid, in-field assay for measuring FIB concentrations in marine water environments. Cov-IMS/ATP is a potential alternative detection method, particularly in areas with limited laboratory support and resources, because of its increased economy and portability.},

The microarray assay has recently emerged as a promising alternative for environmental pathogen monitoring. In this study, bacterial pathogens were detected in municipal wastewater using a microarray equipped with short oligonucleotide probes targeting 16S rRNA sequences. To date, 62 probes have been designed against 38 species, 4 genera, and 1 family of pathogens. The detection sensitivity of the microarray for a waterborne pathogen Aeromonas hydrophila was determined to be approximately 1.0{\%} of the total DNA, or approximately 10(3)A. hydrophila cells per sample. The efficacy of the DNA microarray was verified in a parallel study where pathogen genes and E. coli cells were enumerated using real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) and standard membrane filter techniques, respectively. The microarray and qPCR successfully detected multiple wastewater pathogen species at different stages of the disinfection process (i.e. secondary effluents vs. disinfected final effluents) and at two treatment plants employing different disinfection methods (i.e. chlorination vs. UV irradiation). This result demonstrates the effectiveness of the DNA microarray as a semi-quantitative, high throughput pathogen monitoring tool for municipal wastewater.},

The aims were to assess the feasibility of determining candidate indicators of recreational water quality and to assess the possible scale of variability of these parameters. The numbers of total coliforms were difficult to determine reliably because of interference from the background bacterial flora. There was a strong correlation between thermotolerant coliforms and E. coli and faecal streptococci. The average counts of the indicator organisms varied between and within the eight recreational waters by up to 10 000-fold. The greatest variation was between the eight recreational waters. At any one water, the greatest source of variation was time but there was substantial variation between sample points at one time. Counts in samples collected 1 m apart exhibited greater than random variation. Counts from surface samples tended to be higher than those at 30 cm or 100 cm depth. The proportion of thermotolerant coliforms confirmed to be E. coli varied from water to water between 60{\%} and 96{\%}.},

	annote = {An urbanized coastal ocean that has complex topography and large-scale atmospheric and oceanographic forcing can contain a variety of sediment and pollutant distribution patterns. For example, the central southern California Bight has two large embayments, Santa Monica and San Pedro Bays, that are connected by a short, very narrow shelf off the Palos Verdes peninsula. The complex topography causes quite different oceanographic and sediment distribution patterns in this fairly small region of the coastal ocean. In addition, three sewage outfalls discharge material over the outer shelf. A large suite of sediment cores was obtained and analyzed for contaminants, physical properties, accumulation rates, and grain sizes. Arrays of instrumented moorings that monitor currents, waves, water clarity, water density and collect resuspended materials were deployed. The data and models developed for the Palos Verdes margin suggest that a large reservoir of DDT and its byproducts exists in the coastal ocean sediment and will continue to be exhumed and transported along the shelf for a long time. On the Santa Monica shelf, very large internal waves, or bores, are generated at the shelf break. The near-bottom currents associated with these waves sweep sediment and the associated contaminants from the shelf onto the continental slope. On the San Pedro margin an initial examination of recent data collected in the coastal ocean does not suggest that bacterial contamination on local beaches is primarily caused by transport of material from the adjacent ocean outfall.},

Physical and bacterial indicators were measured. Detailed temperature distribution and currents were studied concurrently with the bacterial counts in the water samples and bottom muds. Due to the high discharge rate and concentrated momentum energy, the thermal plume extended across the river and provided extensive impact on the mixing of the sewage discharge plume and the river flow. The sewage discharge plume was forced to meander along the east side of the river and was trapped into the longshore current zone. Steep gradients of bacterial concentration along the inshore area provided some evidence of the coastal pollution problems in the area. Tables and diagrams are appended.},

The detection of Cryptosporidium oocysts, its transmissive stage, is used in the latest U.S. Environmental Protection Agency method 1622, which utilizes organic fluorophores such as fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) to label the oocysts by conjugation with anti- Cryptosporidium sp. monoclonal antibody (MAb). However, FITC exhibits low resistance to photodegradation. This property will inevitably limit the detection accuracy after a short period of continuous illumination. In view of this, the use of inorganic fluorophores, such as quantum dot (QD), which has a high photobleaching threshold, in place of the organic fluorophores could potentially enhance oocyst detection. In this study, QD605-streptavidin together with biotinylated MAb was used for C. parvum oocyst detection. The C. parvum oocyst detection sensitivity increased when the QD605-streptavidin concentration was increased from 5 to 15 nM and eventually leveled off at a saturation concentration of 20 nM and above. The minimum QD605-streptavidin saturation concentration for detecting up to 4,495 +/- 501 oocysts (mean +/- standard deviation) was determined to be 20 nM. The difference in the enumeration between 20 nM QD605-streptavidin with biotinylated MAb and FITC-MAb was insignificant (P > 0.126) when various C. parvum oocyst concentrations were used. The QD605 was highly photostable while the FITC intensity decreased to 19.5{\%} +/- 5.6{\%} of its initial intensity after 5 min of continuous illumination. The QD605-based technique was also shown to be sensitive for oocyst detection in reservoir water. This observation showed that the QD method developed in this study was able to provide a sensitive technique for detecting C. parvum oocysts with the advantage of having a high photobleaching threshold.},

	annote = {Ocean outfalls along the southeast Florida coast do not discharge into the Gulf Stream, but rather into a narrow strip of coastal water which is directly under the influence of the Florida Current. Due to lateral meanders of this current and production of spin off eddies, outfalls located at the 90 foot isobath will discharge into either the coastal water, the western edge of the Florida Current or the western portion of a cyclonic eddy. The current produced by the complicated interplay of the Florida Current with the eastern edge of the Continental Shelf will be predominantly north or south, but a sizeable westerly component often occurs. The rate of recurrence of eddies is such that the residence time of coastal water is of the order of one week. When sewage is discharged from an ocean outfall, the buoyancy of the less dense sewage effluent causes it to rise to the surface as a 'boil'. The sewage will then follow the prevailing current and spread out in a 'plume'. The sewage will dilute with sea water in the rising boil to about 100:1 of its original concentration. The downstream dilution is rather slow providing an additional dilution approximately 10:1 at 1 nautical mile from the outfall. The untreated sewage released from the Pompano Beach outfall will produce a very large area of surface water which is polluted when judged by the Florida state bacterial standard for body contact. In general, this area will be several miles long and several hundred feet wide with the major dimension being oriented along the direction of the prevailing current. A high degree of treatment (99{\%} or above) for bacterial removal is necessary for an outfall such as the one at Pompano Beach if one is to provide a high degree of confidence that immediate near shore waters are safe for bathing in the worst possible current conditions. A higher bacterial discharge rate through the outfall will require better sewage treatment to meet the same standard.},

For each of these sampling strategies, we included in the simulation the local custom of adaptive sampling, in which a site is resampled the following day if bacterial concentrations exceed the State of California's beach water quality standards. We found that sampling five times per week resulted in observing about 80{\%} of the events in which State standards were exceeded. This frequency dropped to 55{\%}, 25{\%}, and 5{\%} for three times per week, weekly, and monthly sampling, respectively. Adaptive sampling was ineffective because nearly 70{\%} of the water quality exceedences were single-day events, even at the most frequently contaminated sites. This high frequency of single-day events is of concern because the public is typically notified about water quality conditions 24-48 h after samples are collected, meaning that most warnings are out-of-date when they are issued. {\copyright}2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Because these organisms are potentially transmitted through natural waters, this study was carried out to estimate the concentrations of both pathogens in a French coastal watershed and to determine the relationships with fecal indicators. Water samples from nine wastewater treatment plants and eight rivers were analyzed. Although both pathogens and indicators are released from sewage effluents, no clear correlation was found between the two enteric pathogens nor between a given pathogen and fecal indicators. These results suggest that fecal indicators do not adequately indicate the presence of Cryptosporidium and Salmonella in natural waters and that pathogens and indicators may have different behaviors in the aquatic environment. {\copyright}2002 Federation of European Microbiological Societies.

To assess the possible impact of these populations on recreational waters, gull droppings collected at three colonies were examined for fecal coliforms, Aeromonas spp., Campylobacter spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella spp. and Staphylococcus aureus. The samples were also analyzed for Shigella spp. and Yersinia spp. The samples were collected every two weeks from late April to mid-July. The measured concentrations were compared on the basis of colony, age class and sampling date by analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Fisher's LSD multiple range test. In general, there was little difference in bacterial content as a function of age groups, colony or sampling date. On the basis of the documented ratios between the various pathogens and total coliforms in the droppings, the limit of 200 fecal coliforms per 100 ml of water used for recreational water quality in Canada provides an acceptable level of protection with respect to contamination by gulls. However, we must qualify these findings by stating that they reflect the situation that existed at the time of sampling, that they apply to a small number of pathogenic microorganisms, and that they do not take into account soil or sand contamination at beaches.},

Selection of the number of latent variables to build a representative model is an important issue. A metric frequently used by chemometricians for the determination of the number of latent variables is that of Wold's R criterion, whilst more recently a number of statisticians have advocated the use of Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). In this paper, a comparison between Wold's R criterion and AIC for the selection of the number of latent variables to include in a PLS model that will form the basis of a multivariate statistical process control representation is undertaken based on a simulation study. It is shown that neither Wold's R criterion nor AIC exhibit satisfactory performance. This is in contrast to the adjusted Wold's R criteria which is shown to demonstrate satisfactory performance in terms of the number of times the known true model is selected. Two industrial applications are then used to demonstrate the methodology. The first relates to the modelling of a product quality using data from an industrial fluidised bed reactor and the second focuses on an industrial NIR data set. The results are consistent with those of the simulation studies.},

We first measured the relationship between air temperature and the internal temperature of bovine feces exposed to sunlight on commercial operations throughout California. Once maximum air temperature exceeded the mid 20 $\,^{\circ}$C, diurnal thermal regimes of bovine fecal material exhibited peaks of over 40, 50, 60, and 70 $\,^{\circ}$C. These diurnal thermal regimes were emulated using a thermocycler, with oocysts suspended in distilled water or fecal-water mix. Using oral inoculations of 105 C. parvum oocysts per neonatal Balb/c mouse (>1000- fold the ID50), no infections were observed using 1 to 5-day cycles of these thermal regimes. Loss of infectivity induced by these thermal regimes was primarily due to partial or complete in vitro excystation during the first 24-h diurnal cycle and secondarily to thermal inactivation of the remaining intact or partial oocysts. These results suggest that as ambient conditions generate internal fecal temperatures g40 $\,^{\circ}$C via conduction, radiation, and convection, rapid environmental inactivation occurs at a rate ofg3.27 log reduction d-1 forC. parvum oocysts deposited in the feces of cattle.},

Methods and Results: The stationary-phase bacterial cells collected from rich agar media were transferred to 10 ml of sterile water or PBS (pH 7{\AE}2) containing KH2PO4, 15{\AE}44 lM; NaCl, 1{\AE}55 mM; Na2HPO4, 27{\AE}09 lM in a screw-cap tube. The tubes were sealed with parafilm membranes and stored in the dark and at room temperature. Almost all the bacteria tested (148 strains), including Pseudomonas fluorescens, P. viridiflava, Erwinia spp., Xanthomonas campestris, Cytophaga johnsonae, Salmonella spp., Yersinia enterocolitica, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Listeria monocytogenes and Staphylococcus aureus, survived in water for at least several months and up to 16 years. A vast majority of the Gram-negative bacteria tested survived equally well in water and in PBS for at least 30 weeks. However, the populations of two Gram-positive bacteria [G(+)], L. monocytogenes and Staph. aureus, declined more rapidly in water than in PBS. Conclusions: Plant- and human-pathogenic bacteria can be preserved in pure water or PBS for several years. G(+) bacteria appear to survive better in PBS than in water. Significance and Impact of the Study: The method described here is a simple and economical means for preservation of bacterial cultures, which is especially useful for laboratories not equipped with the lyophilizer or ultra-low freezer. Long-term survival of food-borne pathogens in water underlines the importance of water as a potential vehicle for transmitting the diseases.},

	annote = {A new EU Bathing Water Directive was implemented in March 2006, which sets a series of stringent microbiological standards. One of the main requirements of the new Directive is to provide the public with information on conditions likely to lead to short-term coastal pollution. The paper describes how numerical models have been combined with Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to develop an accurate and rapid tool for assessing the bathing water status of the Ribble Estuary, UK. Faecal coliform was used as the water quality indicator. In order to provide enough data for training and testing the neural networks, a calibrated hydrodynamic and water quality model was run for various river flow and tidal conditions. In developing the neural network model a novel data analysis tool called WinGamma was used in the model identification process. WinGamma is capable of determining the data noise level, even with the underlying function unknown, and whether or not a smooth model can be developed. Model predictions based on this technique show a good generalisation ability of the neural networks. Details are given of a series of experiments being undertaken to test the ANN model performance for different numbers of input parameters. The main focus has been to quantify the impact of including time series inputs of faecal coliform on the neural network performance. The response time of the receiving water quality to the river boundary conditions, obtained from the hydrodynamic model, has been shown to provide valuable knowledge for developing accurate and efficient neural networks. {\copyright}2007 Elsevier Ltd.

However, univariate analysis does not explicitly test for interactions between distributed areas of activity and is not sensitive to distributed responses across the brain. Multivariate analysis can explicitly test for multiple statistical models, including the designed paradigm, and allows for spatial and temporal model detection. Here, we investigate multivariate analysis approaches that take into consideration the 4D (time and space) covariance structure of the data. Principal component analysis (PCA) and independent component analysis (ICA) are two popular multivariate approaches with distinct mathematical constraints. Common difficulties in using these two different decompositions include the following: classification of the revealed components (task-related signal versus noise), overall signal-to-noise sensitivity, and the relatively low computational efficiency (multivariate analysis requires the entire raw data set and more time for model identification analysis). Using both Monte Carlo simulations and empirical data, we derived and tested the generalized partial least squares (gPLS) framework, which can incorporate both PCA and ICA decompositions with computational efficiency. The gPLS method explicitly incorporates the experimental design to simplify the identification of characteristic spatiotemporal patterns. We performed parametric modeling studies of a blocked-design experiment under various conditions, including background noise distribution, sampling rate, and hemodynamic response delay. We used a randomized grouping approach to manipulate the degrees of freedom of PCA and ICA in gPLS to characterize both paradigm coherent and transient brain responses. Simulation data suggest that in the gPLS framework, PICA mostly outperforms ICA as measured by the receiver operating curves (ROCs) in SNR from 0.01 to 100, the hemodynamic response delays from 0 to 3 TR in fMRI, background noise models of Guassian, sub-Gaussian, and super-Gaussian distributions and the number of observations from 5, 10, to 20 in each block of a six-block experiment. Further, due to selective averaging, the gPLS method performs robustly in low signal-to-noise ratio (<1) experiments. We also tested PCA and ICA using PLS in a simulated event-related fMRI data to show their similar detection. Finally, we tested our gPLS approach on empirical fMRI motor data. Using the randomized grouping method, we are able to identify both transient responses and consistent paradigm/model coherent components in the 10-epoch block design motor fMRI experiment. Overall, studies of synthetic and empirical data suggest that PLS analysis, using PCA decomposition, provides a stable and powerful tool for exploration of fMRI/behavior data. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc.

The potential adverse impacts of wastewater can affect both the environment and human health; however, because of the high decay rate of bacterial indicators in coral reef waters it has been difficult to document the presence of microbial contaminants and to assign risks in these environments. Here we show initial evidence that microorganisms associated with human feces are concentrated along the surface of coral heads relative to the overlying water column in the Florida Keys. Bacterial indicators (fecal coliform bacteria, enterococci or Clostridium perfringens) were detected in 66.7{\%} of the coral surface microlayer (CSM) samples at levels between five and 1000 CFU/100 ml, but were found infrequently and at low numbers in the overlying water column (62.5 CFU/100 ml). Similarly, enterovirus nucleic acid sequences, an indicator of human-specific waste, were detected in 93.3{\%} of the CSM samples and only once in the water column by cell culture. Results show that coral mucus may accumulate enteric microorganisms in reef environments, and may indicate a risk to public and environmental health despite low indicator levels in the surrounding water.},

However, seals in the MHI may be exposed to a broad range of human, pet, livestock, and feral animal pathogens. Our objective was to determine the movement and foraging habitats of Hawaiian monk seals in the MHI relative to the potential exposure of seals to infectious diseases in near-shore marine habitats. We captured 18 monk seals in the MHI between January 27, 2004 and November 29, 2005, tested them for various infectious diseases, and then monitored the foraging movements of 11 of them using satellite-linked radio transmitters for the next 32-167 days. All seals tested negative for canine adenovirus, calicivirus, four morbilliviruses, phocine herpes virus, Leptospira sp., and feline and canine heartworm antigen/antibody. Six of the seals tested positive on complement fixation for Chlamydophila abortus (formerly Chlamydia psittaci). Four seals demonstrated positive titers to Sarcocystis neurona, two to Neospora caninum, and two to Toxoplasma gondii. Fecal cultures showed approximately half (n = 6) positive for E. coli 0157, no Salmonella sp., and only one with Campylobacter sp. Satellite monitored seals spent considerable time foraging, traveling, and resting in neritic waters close to human population centers, agricultural activity, and livestock ranges, and sources of land-based water runoff and sewage dispersal. Consequently, Hawaiian monk seals in the MHI may be at risk of exposure to several infectious disease agents associated with terrestrial animals that can contaminate marine habitats from runoff along drainages and that are known to cause disease in marine mammals. Further, some seals overlapped substantially in their use of coastal habitats and several moved among islands while foraging and were seen on beaches near each other. This suggests that diseased seals could infect healthy conspecifics throughout the MHI. {\copyright}2006 Ecohealth Journal Consortium.},

The principal factor influencing the detection limit of G. lamblia and Shigella was sample volume. The principal factor influencing the detection limit of the remaining bacteria and protozoa, includingE. coli O157:H7,Salmonella, and Cryptosporidium parvum, was the presence of inhibitory compounds in the purified nucleic acid extracts. Both recovery and inhibition adversely impacted the detection limit of viruses.

Coliform data were collected inside and outside the boom over a three-year period. The results showed a 93{\%} reduction in total coliforms and a 73{\%} reduction in fecal coliforms, based on a comparison of the medians. Exceedences of the applicable water quality standards were reduced by 98{\%} for total coliforms, and 81{\%} for fecal coliforms. The method by which the boom actually reduces bacteria levels is thought to be a combination of filtration of solids, and the alteration of hydraulic conditions at the beach. {\copyright}2008 ASCE.},

	annote = {In this study, we applied a genome fragment enrichment (GFE) method to select for genomic regions that differ among different fecal metagenomes. Competitive DNA hybridizations were performed between chicken fecal DNA and pig fecal DNA (CP) and between chicken fecal DNA and an avian DNA composite consisting of turkey, goose, and seagull fecal DNA extracts (CB) to enrich for chicken-specific DNA fragments. A total of 471 non-redundant chicken metagenomic sequences were retrieved and analyzed. All of the clone sequences were similar to prokaryotic genes, of which more than 60{\%} could not be assigned to previously characterized functional roles. In general terms, sequences assigned characterized functional roles were associated with cellular processes (11.7{\%}), metabolism (11.0{\%}) and information storage and processing (13.4{\%}). Approximately 53{\%} of the non-redundant sequences are similar to genes present in intestinal bacteria belonging to Clostridia (20.9{\%}), Bacteroidetes (15.0{\%}), and Bacilli (17.3{\%}). Twenty-five sequences from the CP and CB clone libraries were selected to develop chicken fecal-specific PCR assays. These assays were challenged against fecal DNA extracted from 21 different animal species, including mammals and birds. The results from the host-specificity studies showed that 12 of the assays had a high degree of specificity to chicken feces. In addition, three assays were specific to chicken and turkey while another four assays tested positive to more than two avian species, suggesting a broader distribution of some of the enriched gene fragments among different avian fecal microbial communities. Fecal pollution signals were detected using chicken-specific assays in contaminated water samples, although the PCR assays showed different detection limits. These results indicate the need for multiple assays to detect poultry fecal sources of pollution. The competitive DNA hybridization approach used in this study can rapidly select for numerous chicken fecal metagenomic regions that can be used as potential genetic markers for fecal source tracking.},

	annote = {In spite of increasing public health concerns about the potential risks associated with swimming in waters contaminated with waterfowl feces, little is known about the composition of the gut microbial community of aquatic birds. To address this, a gull 16S rRNA gene clone library was developed and analyzed to determine the identities of fecal bacteria. Analysis of 282 16S rRNA gene clones demonstrated that the gull gut bacterial community is mostly composed of populations closely related to Bacilli (37%), Clostridia (17%), Gammaproteobacteria (11%), and Bacteriodetes (1%). Interestingly, a considerable number of sequences (i.e., 26%) were closely related to Catellicoccus marimammalium, a gram-positive, catalasenegative bacterium. To determine the occurrence of C. marimammalium in waterfowl, species-specific 16S rRNA gene PCR and real-time assays were developed and used to test fecal DNA extracts from different bird (n = 13) and mammal (n = 26) species. The results showed that both assays were specific to gull fecal DNA and that C. marimammalium was present in gull fecal samples collected from the five locations in North America (California, Georgia, Ohio, Wisconsin, and Toronto, Canada) tested. Additionally, 48 DNA extracts from waters collected from six sites in southern California, Great Lakes in Michigan, Lake Erie in Ohio, and Lake Ontario in Canada presumed to be impacted with gull feces were positive by the C. marimammalium assay. Due to the widespread presence of this species in gulls and environmental waters contaminated with gull feces, targeting this bacterial species might be useful for detecting gull fecal contamination in waterfowl-impacted waters.},

Methods and Results: Faecal coliform bacteria, enterococci, spores of sulphite-reducing clostridia, somatic coliphages, F-specific RNA bacteriophages and bacteriophages infecting Bacteroides fragilis were determined by standardized methods in raw sewage and in 392 samples of river water from 22 sampling sites in 10 rivers in Argentina, Colombia, France and Spain, which represent very different climatic and socio-economic conditions. The results showed that the indicators studied maintained the same relative densities in the raw sewage from the different areas. Classifying the river water samples according to the content of faecal coliform bacteria, it can be observed that the relative densities of the different bacterial indicators and bacteriophages changed according to the concentration of faecal coliform bacteria. There was a relative increase in the densities of all groups of bacteriophages and sulphite-reducing clostridia with respect to faecal coliforms and enterococci in the samples with low counts of faecal coliform bacteria. Conclusions: The numbers of bacterial indicators and bacteriophages were similar in the different geographical areas studied. Once released in rivers, the persistence of the different micro-organisms differed significantly. Bacteriophages and spores of sulphite-reducing clostridia persisted longer than faecal coliforms and enterococci. Significance and Impact of the Study: Bacteriophages in river water samples provide additional information to that provided by bacteria about the fate of faecal micro-organisms in river water. The easy, fast and cheap methods for phage determination are feasible both in industrialized and developing countries.},

The basin is composed of mixed but primarily agricultural land uses. From March 2004 to November 2007, a total of 2,004 surface water samples were collected from 24 sampling sites. E. coli densities ranged from undetectable to 1.64 x 105 CFU 100 ml--1 and were correlated with stream order and proximity to livestock production systems. The diversity of 21,307 E. coli isolates was characterized using repetitive extragenic palindromic PCR (rep-PCR), allowing for the identification of as many as 7,325 distinct genotypes, without capturing all of the diversity. The community was temporally and spatially dominated by a few dominant genotypes (clusters of more than 500 isolates) and several genotypes of intermediary abundance (clustering between 10 and 499 isolates). Simpson diversity indices, assessed on a normalized number of isolates per sample, ranged from 0.050 to 0.668. Simpson indices could be statistically discriminated on the basis of year and stream order, but land use, discharge, weather, and water physical-chemical properties were not statistically important discriminators. The detection of Campylobacter species was associated with statistically lower Simpson indices (greater diversity; P < 0.05). Waterborne E. coli isolates from genotypes of dominant and intermediary abundance were clustered with isolates obtained from fecal samples collected in the study area over the same period, and 90{\%} of the isolates tested proved to share genotypes with fecal isolates. Overall, our data indicated that the densities and distribution of E. coli in these mixed-use watersheds were linked to stream order and livestock-based land uses. Waterborne E. coli populations that were distinct from fecal isolates were detected and, on this basis, were possibly naturalized E. coli strains.},

These criteria appear to be a product of water laboratory scientists and legislators, bypassing the person most concerned - the local medical officer with his experience and knowledge of parochial epidemiology. In Natal we have a sophisticated and stringent system of grading bathing beaches which includes pathogenic microorganisms. The system functions as a measuring device for assessing changes in water quality, not as an arbitrary health standard. It is hoped that the practice of setting capricious so-called health standards for marine recreational waters does not spread to South Africa.},

Both beaches were tideless, open marine, and fully exposed to wave action; one was polluted with domestic sewage and the other showed no obvious signs of sewage pollution. Interstitial water was sampled by a glass sampler that had been designed to minimize contamination. Wave wash zone interstitial water was near oxygen saturation on both beaches when moderate waves were present. Interstitial water 10 to 20 m back (ground water) contained appreciable amounts of oxygen and were low in oxygen content only when corresponding to conditions of high nutrient input coupled with calm sea (low wave activity) and wind conditions. Samples on these transects were alos taken to quantify the bacteria (total and viable) and meiofauna along with sand samples for protein determination and interstitial water samples for phosphate and ammonia determinations. The relationship of oxygen and carbon dioxide to their rates of entry and removal are discussed. {\copyright}1973.},

Urban runoff has been reported to contain pathogenic organisms, but this probably presents little direct threat to human health because the runoff is not ingested. Runoff water, however, can have other negative effects such as contamination of surface waters, which may result in beach closures, or contamination of shellfish. Every storm producing runoff is unique in terms of the number and type of micro-organisms, for they vary from site to site, from storm to storm, and over time during any one storm event. Stormwater to be examined for micro-organisms must be collected in sterile containers and processed immediately. Refs.},

Moving downstream with animal feces in storm water runoff or with human waste in sewage overflows and septic-tank leaks, the waterborne microbes can cause liver disease, respiratory infections and potentially fatal gastrointestinal disorders.

	annote = {At the end of the summer, drifting filamentous red algae cover shallow bottoms and accumulate in huge cast walls on the open shores of the non-tidal central Baltic Sea. The hypotheses that beach cleaning increases water clarity, decreases the organic content of the sand, and increases the species diversity in the shallow zone closest to the shore, were tested through field investigations and experiments. Cleaned shorelines were compared with un-cleaned shorelines at two sites with different intensity of beach cleaning in a rural area of SE Sweden. The results show that water clarity was significantly increased off the intensively cleaned beach but not off the moderately cleaned one. Similarly, the total leakage of nitrogenous compounds decreased off the intensively cleaned beach, but not off the moderately cleaned. The organic content of the sand was lower on both cleaned beaches compared with nearby uncleaned beaches. The total animal biomass was significantly lower on the intensively cleaned beach compared with the un-cleaned beach, but the moderately cleaned beach gave no such effect. The difference in biodiversity and community structure between cleaned and un-cleaned beaches was insignificant. The most obvious difference in species composition was a much higher number of planktivore opossum shrimps of the genus Mysis and Praunus on the un-cleaned beaches. The bacterial production and the amount of ciliates larger than 20 mm were also higher on un-cleaned beaches, indicating that the microbial food web off the un-cleaned beaches is stimulated by the discharge of decomposing algal material. The conclusion of the study is that mechanical cleaning reduces the organic content of the beach sand and may change the water quality and microbial production, but the effect on the macrofaunal biodiversity is insignificant. {\copyright}2004 Elsevier Ltd.

	annote = {Discharges of urban stormwater and combined sewer overflows (CSOs) contribute to fecal contamination of urban waters and need to be considered in planning the protection of recreational waters and sources of drinking water. Stormwater characterization indicates that Escherichia coli counts in stormwater typically range from 103 to 104 units per 100 ml. Higher counts (105 units/100 ml) suggest the presence of cross-connections with sanitary sewers, and such connections should be identified and corrected. Fecal contamination of stormwater may be attenuated prior to discharge into surface waters by stormwater management measures, which typically remove suspended solids and attached bacteria. Exceptionally, stormwater discharges in the vicinity of swimming beaches are disinfected. The levels of indicator bacteria in CSOs can be as high as 106 E. coli per 100ml. Consequently, the abatement of fecal contamination of CSOs is now considered in the design of CSO control and treatment, as for example stipulated in the Ontario Procedure F-5-5. CSO abatement options comprise combinations of storage and treatment, in which the CSO treatment generally includes disinfection by ultraviolet (UV) irradiation. Finally, indicator bacteria data from Sarnia (Ontario) were used to demonstrate some fecal contamination impacts of wet-weather flows. In wet weather, the microbiological quality of riverine water worsened as a result of CSO and stormwater discharges, and the recreational water guidelines for indicator organisms were exceeded most of the time. Local improvements in water quality were feasible by source controls and diversion of polluted water.},

	annote = {The EU Water Framework Directive represents a major change in the management of water resources and sets ambitious ecological objectives for all European waters. In the Directive, the economic assessment of the non-market environmental benefits of water quality improvements plays a crucial role. Studies valuing these benefits are now appearing in the literature, applying stated preference valuation techniques. However, these techniques are often criticized for providing only narrow mono-criterion information to the decision-making process. The research presented here builds on a recent line of investigation that combines monetary stated preference tools, in this case a choice experiment, with multi-criteria analysis, in this case the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP). We argue that the AHP can contribute to a better understanding and interpretation of the choice experiment results by exploring the criteria involved in respondents' trade-off between the attributes. The AHP provides relevant insights for the application of use-based water quality ladders in the valuation of environmental benefits in the context of the WFD. Results also show the importance of the spatial dimension of preferences for water quality.},

	annote = {The basic aim of investigations into the health effects of swimming or bathing has always been to determine what difference in illness incidence might be expected from swimming in waters containing varying degrees of bacterial pollution. Most studies have been of the prospective epidemic-logical type, now generally termed "Cabelli-styte", after the first study conducted by the EPA in the 1970's. Trained staff approached people leaving the beach and asked them to take part in the study by filling in a questionnaire including details about whether they had entered the water,swum or bathed, their various activities on the beach, their age, employment and details about their state of health .The state of health of these people and their families was followed up. The microorganisms employed to assess water quality varied from one to a combination of total and faecal coliforms, faecal streptococci, E. coli, enterococci and staphylococci. Prospective studies were carried out in Alexandria, Egypt (1980), two in Tel-Aviv , Israeli 1983 \& 1991), three in Spain (1983), two in France (1983 \& 1987), two in Canada (1985 \& 1989), Turkey (1989), Hong Kong (1988) and Australia ( 1989). Practically all of them obtained results in the form of higher morbidity among bathers as compared to non-bathers, the best correlation with water quality being with one or other microorganism where different beaches were compared. Faecal streptococci counts showed a significant relation with the occurrence of gastroenteritis in the 1 -4 age group. The prospective studies received strong criticism concerning the accuracy of their protocol and the comparability of their results. During the last five years a "health volunteer" design has been tried in the U.K. A first step included two pilot studies which were followed by larger-scale ones. Healthy volunteers were recruited and divided into bathing and non-bathing cohorts. Clinical tests were held both before and after exposure. While significantly higher rates of sore thoat, ear and eye symptoms were reported by the bathers three days after the study and diarrhoea three weeks later, there was no correlation between the results of the clinical tests and the perceived symptoms reported. Faecal streptococci counts, measured at chest level, showed a significant dose-response relation with gastroenteritis. Adverse health effects were identified when faecal streptococci counts exceeded 32/100 ml. Studies in our laboratory showed significantly higher counts of staphylococci and anthropogenic fungi when the number of swimmers on the beach increased.},

Research activities which may be germane to point versus diffuse source pollution include studies on bathing beaches, aerosols from sewage treatment plants, and toxic effluents. In order to determine new criteria for recreational water quality, a study was conducted in which water quality was measured by as many methods as possible and then correlated with illness related to sewage pollution. The best indicator to fit the illness data was the Enterococcus density as measured by a method developed in the study. For an increased illness rate of 1{\%}, the Enterococcus density would be 13.6 per decaliter and for 5{\%} increased illness, 906 per 100 ml. Another problem area studied was the health effects of siting of sewage treatment plants. Despite the fact that some microorganisms are emitted by aeration basins of a sewage treatment plant, there is no detectable increase of disease in persons exposed to the aerosols, including sewage treatment plant workers. As part of th development of Criteria Documents, the laboratory was involved in determining the human health effects portion of 20 of the 65 consent decree documents. most critical to the Great Lakes are the toxic pollutants that have significant bioaccumulation. Because of the Great Lakes fishery resource such toxic pollutants will require close surveillance, particularly in populations where the average fish consumption is greatly exceeded. (Brambley-SRC)},

Artificial hydrographs were generated on eight occasions between 21 October 1979 and 3 March 1981 by releasing water from Thruscross Reservoir in North Yorkshire into Fewston Reservoir. The majority of the releases were made after rainless periods to isolate the effects of stream channel entrainment from those induced by rainfall on the land surface. In the absence of rainfall, bacterial concentrations are shown to increase more than 10-fold in response to stage increases. It is suggested that two stores of bacteria must exist on the catchment, the first being a land store and the second a channel or near-channel store. Movement from the land to the channel store must relate to hill slope hydrological processes, whereas movement between stores in the channel fluvial system may be closely allied to sedimentary processes. Some consideration is given to bacterial levels in relation to European Economic Communities guidelines for contact recreation.},

	annote = {Partial least squares (PLS) analysis has been used to characterize distributed signals measured by neuroimaging methods like positron emission tomography (PET), functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), event-related potentials (ERP) and magnetoencephalography (MEG). In the application to PET, it has been used to extract activity patterns differentiating cognitive tasks, patterns relating distributed activity to behavior, and to describe large-scale interregional interactions or functional connections. This paper reviews the more recent extension of PLS to the analysis of spatiotemporal patterns present in fMRI, ERP, and MEG data. We present a basic mathematical description of PLS and discuss the statistical assessment using permutation testing and bootstrap resampling. These two resampling methods provide complementary information of the statistical strength of the extracted activity patterns (permutation test) and the reliability of regional contributions to the patterns (bootstrap resampling). Simulated ERP data are used to guide the basic interpretation of spatiotemporal PLS results, and examples from empirical ERP and fMRI data sets are used for further illustration. We conclude with a discussion of some caveats in the use of PLS, including nonlinearities, nonorthogonality, and interpretation difficulties. We further discuss its role as an important tool in a pluralistic analytic approach to neuroirnaging. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

We conducted a yearlong time series investigation of Newport Bay, a regionally important estuarine embayment in southern California, assessing the concentrations of FIB, specifically Escherichia coli and enterococci bacteria, and salinity. In total, eight within-bay stations and one offshore control site were sampled nearly once per week and the three tributaries draining into Newport Bay were sampled approximately daily. Using salinity as a conservative tracer for water mass mixing and determining the end-member values of FIB in both the creek sites and the offshore site, we created a linear, two end-member mixing model of FIB within Newport Bay. Deviations from the mixing model suggest either an additional source of FIB to the bay (e.g. bird feces, storm drain discharge) or regrowth and/or die-off of FIB within the bay. Our results indicate that salinity mixing models can be useful in predicting changes in FIB concentrations in the estuarine environments and can help narrow the search for sources of FIB to the bay and enhance our understanding of the fate of FIB within the bay.},

Identical PFGE patterns were found for numerous isolates from 4 of the 9 days sampled, suggesting environmental replication. 16S rRNA gene sequencing, API 20E biochemical testing, and the absence of beta -glucuronidase activity revealed that these clonal isolates were Klebsiella, Citrobacter, and Enterobacter spp. In contrast, 82{\%} of the nonclonal isolates from water samples were confirmed to be E. coli, and 16{\%} were identified as other fecal coliforms. These nonclonal isolates produced a diverse range of PFGE patterns similar to those of isolates obtained directly from untreated sewage and gull droppings. beta -Glucuronidase activity was critical in distinguishing E. coli from other fecal coliforms, particularly for the clonal isolates. These findings demonstrate that E. coli is a better indicator of fecal pollution than fecal coliforms, which may replicate in the environment and falsely elevate indicator organism levels.},

Antecedent rainfall and subsequent river flow can significantly increase the concentrations of faecal indicator organisms in bathing waters. The SEPA signage prediction tool, an Excel spreadsheet based model, was developed and used to set site-specific criteria for rainfall and river flow to predict bathing water quality based on historical data. Real-time predictions against the current EU Bathing Water Directive were correct or precautionary on 99% of days and correct for 82% of compliance samples during 2007, and 81% of compliance samples during the 2008 season. The revised 2006 Directive sets out more stringent bathing water quality standards which require increased model performance. New predictive models are now being trailed using decision tree statistical software and are intended to replace the existing prediction tool by 2012.},

One of these outbreaks occurred in the summer of 1990, at a recreational beach near Amsterdam. In the summer of 1991, a survey was conducted to examine the presence of P. shigelloides in recreational fresh waters and marine water in the Netherlands. During the survey became clear that the specificity of current methods for the isolation and enumeration of P. shigelloides in water is low and requires extensive confirmation to obtain accurate data. P. shigelloides was ubiquitously present (30 of 42 samples positive) in fresh waters, but absent in sea water. Geometric mean Plesiomonas densities ranged from 140-340 per 100 ml; the range for individual positive samples was 33-840 per 100 ml. The Plesiomonas density was significantly correlated with index parameters for the trophic state (Secchi depth and chlorophyll A) and for faecal pollution (Escherichia coli). In winter, only 1 of 8 sites harboured P. shigelloides and in low numbers (4.4 per 100 ml). The ubiquitous presence of P. shigelloides in freshwater in the recreational season may result in cases of gastro-enteritis among bathers.},

	annote = {Questions have been raised about the impact of onsite sewage treatment and disposal systems (OSTDS) on adjacent water bodies, particularly in coastal areas. If OSTDS are not properly sited and maintained, they pose a potential risk to public health and may contribute toward degradation of the receiving water body. To quantify the pollutant loading contributions from OSTDS located adjacent to coastal canals, two similar single-family residential neighborhoods were evaluated. One was connected to the sanitary sewer network (Hollywood, FL) and the other was served exclusively by septic tanks (Dania Beach, FL). Water quality sampling, focusing on nutrient and pathogen indicators, was conducted at the paired sites during the seasonal high water table (SHWT) and seasonal low water table (SLWT) events. During the SHWT, measured canal water quality, in terms of nutrient (i.e. nitrate) and microbial pathogen indicators in the adjacent areas appeared to be impacted by OSTDS. However, during the SLWT, no obvious impacts attributable to the septic tanks were detected. This suggests that the OSTDS may operate properly when the water table is low, but that the contributions by OSTDS to coastal pollutant loading may be quantifiable during certain portions of the calendar year when the ground water table elevation is relatively high, although the impact on the downstream marine environment is uncertain as a result of tidal dilution and lack of offshore study. {\copyright}2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

The study was conducted during June, September and December 1993, and March 1994. The region was divided into two areas: (i) Direct Influence Area (DIA), consisting of 20 sampling stations located near to discharge zones of the submarine pipeline system, where collections were carried out at the surface, and (ii) Indirect Influence Area (IIA), located near to the coastal zone, including Barra do Cear{\'a}, Kart{\'o}dromo, Volta de Jurema, Mucuripe, Farol and Ca{\c c}a e Pesca beaches, totalling 26 sampling stations. The most probable number (MPN) of both total and fecal coliforms in DIA was positive only in station number 6, near to the sewage discharge exit. The following bacteria were identified: Citrobacter sp., Enterobacter aerogenes and Escherichia coli. Kart{\'o}dromo beach was contaminated throughout the sampling period. Results of total fecal MPN was essentially lower than 3.0 x 10(2) coliforms/100 ml at Ca{\c c}a e Pesca beach. In December, at both DIA and IIA, Salmonella was identified in several samples. In DIA, the spatial distribution for Salmonella suggests that there should be a coastal sea current from east to west along the coastline. In IIA, Salmonella was identified at Kart{\'o}dromo and Farol beaches throughout the sampling period.},

The use of standard Windows dialog boxes and toolbars also makes the use of the model system attractive. Model output ranges from time series of various parameters to plan view time animations of color coded pollutant levels. Example applications to coastal and estuarine sites are presented to show system capabilities. The first is a tidal hydrodynamics simulation for Delaware Bay.

Spearman rank correlation analysis demonstrated significant relationships between cell number, biomass and actual uptake rate of glucose. The concentration of natural glucose varied with sand-grain shape, and the uptake rates of glucose were inversely correlated with the water content of the sediment. In the overlying water, cell number and/or biomass were significantly correlated with both concentration and uptake rates of glucose. Partial correlation analysis, however, indicates that, in the water overlying the sediment at least one of the standing crop variables (bacterial number or biomass) is independently variable with uptake activity. The sediment bacterial standing crop does not necessarily reflect metabolic activity. Various significant interactions were noted between mainly sediment properties (water content, organic matter content, grain size) and variables in the water above (cell number, biomass, concentration and uptake rates of glucose). {\copyright}1978 Springer-Verlag.},

In this study historical data from 1994 to 2000 was analyzed, and over a period of five weeks water samples were taken and analyzed for bacteria. The analysis of the historical data revealed fundamental sampling problems, which made the data useless for the purpose of this study. The analysis of the data collected for this study showed that exceeding the bathing water standard for bacteria can be predicted by evaluating the SAC with an acceptable accuracy. Furthermore a simple river quality model was implemented, including bacteria as a load fraction. With the help of rain data and discharge predictions expected bacteria numbers exceeding the bathing water standard could also be forecast.},

	annote = {The sea plays an important socioeconomic role in the province of Agadir (southwestern Morocco) but it is the source of several pollutions. The objective of this work was to study the impact of wastewater discharges on the microbiological quality of some beaches in this province. Samples of sea water and sand were made between April and October 1997 in four sites along the Agadir Bay (beaches of Agadir, Amadil, Anza, and Taghazout) to study concentrations of faecal coliforms (FC) and faecal streptococci (FS). Low concentrations of bacteria were found in the sea water from Agadir (a mean of 12.7 FC and 7.5 FS in 100 ml), Amadil (26.0 FC and 5.5 FS/100 ml), and Taghazout (30.0 FC and 10.7 FS/100 ml). In contrast, high concentrations of FC (a mean of 8.10 4/100 ml) and FS (7.9.103/100 ml) were noted in the sea water from Anza. These very high values might be explained by the presence of several wastewater outlet in the immediate vicinity of this beach. Despite several slight fluctuations in the concentrations of FC and FS, the results obtained with sand were similar to those noted with sea water. The individual values of FC and FS recorded in the four sites were subjected to a method of lognormal probability to determine the three following quality parameters: FC80, FC95, and FS90. These last results indicated that the Agadir, Amadil, and Taghazout beaches could be classified in the category A (optimal microbiological quality of sea water for human bathing), while the beach of Anza might be classified in the category D (inadvisable bathing). Even though the values were originating from samples collected during the main tourist season, the same types of samples must be performed every year to follow the fluctuations of pollution in the Agadir Bay.},

Every year millions of people visit the 500 plus recreational beaches in the Great Lakes. An increasing public health risk has been suggested with increased evidence of fecal contamination at the shoreline. To investigate the transport and fate of fecal pollution at Great Lakes beaches and the health risk associated with swimming at these beaches, the near-shore waters of Mt Baldy Beach, Lake Michigan and Trail Creek, a tributary discharging into the lake were examined for fecal pollution indicators. A model of surf zone hydrodynamics coupled with a transport model with first-order inactivation of pollutant was used to understand the relative importance of different processes operating in the surf zone (e.g. physical versus biological processes). The Enterococcus human fecal pollution marker, which targets a putative virulence factor, the enterococcal surface protein (esp) in Enterococcus faecium, was detected in 2/28 samples (7{\%}) from the tributaries draining into Lake Michigan and in 6/30 samples (20{\%}) from Lake Michigan beaches. Preliminary analysis suggests that the majority of fecal indicator bactateria variation and water quality changes at the beaches can be explained by inputs from the influential stream and hydrometeorological conditions. Using modeling methods to predict impaired water quality may help reduce potential health threats to recreational visitors.},

Methods and Results: Species identification was determined for 1413 presumptive Enterococcus isolates from urban runoff, bay, ocean and sewage water samples. The most frequently isolated species were Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus hirae, Enterococcus casseliflavus and Enterococcus mundtii. All five of these species were isolated from ocean and bay water with a frequency ranging from 7{\%} to 36{\%}. Enterococcus casseliflavus was the most frequently isolated species in urban runoff making up 36-65{\%} of isolates while E. faecium was the most frequently isolated species in sewage making up 53-78{\%} of isolates. The similar distribution of species in urban runoff and receiving water suggests that urban runoff may be the source of Enterococcus. No vancomycin or high level gentamycin resistance was detected in E. faecalis and E. faecium isolates. Conclusions: Enterococcus faecalis, E. faecium, E. casseliflavus and E. mundtii are the most commonly isolated Enterococcus species from urban runoff and receiving waters in Southern California. Significance and Impact of the Study: Determination of the Enterococcus species isolated from receiving waters and potential pollution sources may assist in determining the sources of pollution. {\copyright}2008 The Authors.},

Conventional cultural techniques were employed with 768 water specimens, including drinking waters (tap, spring, bore hole and bottled) and recreational waters (swimming pool, lough, river and sea). Positive waters included 1/11 (9.1{\%}) drinking water from untreated well water, as well as 5/12 (41.7{\%}) untreated surface waters from loughs and 7/8 (87.5{\%}) untreated river waters. Overall, untreated surface waters may represent a source of contamination with Campylobacter spp. in Northern Ireland, where they have a recreational involvement or are used as a drinking source by man or agricultural livestock. Therefore waterborne campylobacteriosis should be considered in patients presenting with acute enteritis and a history of participation in water sports/activities. As faecal coliform organisms have been previously shown to be poor markers of water quality, especially for Campylobacter spp, new criteria should be established to assess the risk of this infection and to evaluate and monitor the quality of water used for recreational purposes.},

Methods: Clostridium perfringens were enumerated and isolated from sewage influent, surface water and suspended sediments using the mCP method. Molecular characterization of isolates was performed using species-specific PCR, along with full-length sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene for a subset of isolates. Results: The environmental isolates were presumptively identified as C. perfringens based on utilization of sucrose, inability to ferment cellobiose and a positive action for acid phosphatase activity. All isolates (n = 126) were classified as C. perfringens based on positive results with species-specific PCR with a subset confirmed as C. perfringens based on the 16S rRNA gene identity. Conclusions: The molecular results indicated all of the presumptive positive isolates were C. perfringens regardless of the source, e.g. sewage influent or environmental water samples. Sequencing revealed that C. perfringens obtained from sewage and the aquatic environment were nearly identical (c. 99·5% similarity). Significance and Impact of the Study: From this study we conclude that the mCP method is a robust approach to enumerate and isolate C. perfringens from aquatic environments that receive diverse sources of faecal pollution.},

In contrast, 41.0{\%} of the water samples and 63.4{\%} of the stool samples contained pathogenicity factors specific for extraintestinal E. coli pathogens. While no virulence determinants specific for intestinal E. coli pathogens were found among the investigated environmental water isolates, 4.5{\%} of the stool samples contained either only intestinal or both intestinal and extraintestinal virulence genes. Both the prevalence of the virulence genes and the expression of the corresponding pathogenicity factors were, in general, higher in stool than in water samples.

This raises the possibility that ocean outfall design could itself be looked at from the point of view of the risk to human health from exposure to specific pollutants. An approach to health risk-based design of ocean outfalls is presented in this paper. The approach is based on an integration of the principles of human health risk assessment and ocean outfall design. Hazard identification of rotavirus-used as an example of a typical pathogen in sewage-and dose-response relationships are reviewed. An empirical initial dilution model is combined with secondary dilution and decay models to quantify virus exposures during swimming. The health risk to a swimmer at a specified distance from the outfall discharge is then evaluated by integrating the exposure and dose-response models. Risk of infection, clinical illness, and mortality are all evaluated with a case study using data from an existing outfall. The applicability of the approach to ocean outfall design is presented by quantifying the risks of using a public beach for swimming for a given outfall design scenario. Different scenarios are used to simulate the risk of infection, clinical illness, and mortality, from which the location of the designed outfall may be determined to better assure the safety of swimming areas. A probabilistic analysis is presented to investigate the uncertainty in estimated health risk from potential design scenarios.},

The chromogenic RainbowTM agar O157 medium designed for the rapid identification of E. coli O157:H7 was used for the detection of these organisms in various river-water samples in the Vaal Barrage Reservoir drainage basin of South Africa. A total of 204 samples were obtained from 15 sites where water was used for direct and indirect human consumption. Samples were filtered through Gelman filter-units and incubated on RainbowTM agar O157 which produced different colours according to the bacterial chromogenic properties. Six hundred and sixty-three suspected E. coli O157:H7 colonies, with colours ranging between dark blue, grey and black, were subcultured onto sorbitol-MacConkey agar and screened for different virulence factors specific for E. coli O157:H7 and agglutination with anti-E. coli O157 antiserum. The results indicated that none of the suspected colonies contained all of the virulence factors necessary to classify them as E. coli O157:H7. None of these organisms agglutinated with antisera against E. coli O157. The probability of being infected with E. coli O157:H7 from direct or indirect consumption of these river water sources is therefore low. Some samples did, however, contain enterohaemorrhagic E. coli virulence properties, such as Stx1, Stx2 and enterohaemolysin, which might impose ahea lth risk if ingested.}

Outfalls from combined sewer systems are assumed to be the major source of bacteria to streams in many of these urban areas, including the Rouge River of southeastern Michigan. Current remediation strategies largely disregard other potential sources, including water entering the river from its headwaters region, rural runoff, and contaminated groundwater. These other potential sources of bacterial pollution to the Rouge River were assessed and compared with bacteria contributed from combined sewer outfalls (CSOs). Fecal coliform (FC) and fecal streptococci (FS) densities were determined at 28 locations in the Rouge River Watershed during the spring and summer of 1997, 1998, and 1999. The mean levels of both indicator groups vary considerably along each branch of the river and show no correlation to CSO locations. The magnitude of both FC and FS levels are, in fact, frequently greater at sites upstream of the part of the river influenced by discharges from CSOs. The highest FC levels coincided with rainfall events, but FC levels at various sites along each branch of the Rouge River violated acceptable water quality standards (200 colonies/100 mL) at nearly 50% of the sites even during dry weather. Total suspended solids were moderately correlated with FC (r = 0.79) throughout the watershed, suggesting that solids may play a role in transporting bacteria into the Rouge River. The data depict a strong influence of upstream water and rural runoff on the water quality of the Rouge River. FC to FS ratios (FC/FS) suggest the primary source of bacteria throughout the watershed is from domesticated animals and wildlife and not from sewage derived from CSOs.},

In order to evaluate new virus-based criteria for enforcing recreational water quality standards, a new method based on a broad reverse transcribed polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was set up to detect reoviruses. Two primers were engineered to amplify a 538 base pair fragment of the Sigma 2 gene. Reovirus strains obtained from ATCC (Jones, Lang, Dearing, Abney, NC-TEV, SV59 and SV12) were used as references. Twenty-four samples of 101 were collected from two beaches of the Adriatic sea and 12 from the neighbourhood of Fano Harbour Channel. The presence of environmental reoviruses was tested on both concentrated seawater samples and lysates of BGM cells infected with the concentrated seawater samples. The new method was used in parallel with the detection of a 3:3:4 electrophoretic pattern of reovirus RNA in polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). Enterovirus and bacteria were also screened in compliance with EEC directives. No enteroviruses were isolated, and it was not attributable to reovirus interference. All the reovirus found by PAGE (8/72) were confirmed by RT-PCR, while several genomes (14/72) were detected only by RT-PCR. Presumptive methods of virus identification, that is CPE on BGM cells and haemagglutination test, were not able to detect them. The specificity of RT-PCR products was checked by direct nucleotide sequence analyses of the amplicons. The phylogenetic analyses showed heterogeneous taxa including human and animal reoviruses, with strong evidence that they were spreading consistently from the Harbour-Channel. This novel approach for reovirus detection will be very useful as a trace route of faecal pollution; more importantly, it could be very useful in contributing to the creation of a databank of circulating enteric viruses.},

	booktitle = {Water-Resources Investigations Report},
	annote = {Discharges of fecal bacteria (fecal coliform bacteria and Escherichia coli ) to the middle main stem of the Cuyahoga River from storm water, combined sewers, and incompletely disinfected wastewater have resulted in frequent exceedances of bacteriological water-quality standards in a 23-mile reach of the river that flows through the Cuyahoga Valley National Recreation Area. Contamination of the middle main stem of the Cuyahoga River by bacteria of fecal origin and subsequent transport to downstream areas where water-contact recreation is an important use of the river are a concern because of the potential public-health risk from the presence of enteric pathogens. Independent field investigations of bacterial decay, dilution, dispersion, transport, and sources, and bacterial contamination of streambed sediments, were completed in 1991-93 during periods of rainfall and runoff. The highest concentration of fecal coliform bacteria observed in the middle main stem during three transport studies exceeded the single-sample fecal coliform standard applicable to primary-contact recreation by a factor of approximately 1,300 and exceeded the Escherichia coli standard by a factor of approximately 8,000. The geometric-mean concentrations of fecal bacteria in the middle main stem were 6.7 to 12.3 times higher than geometric-mean concentrations in the monitored tributaries, and 1.8 to 7.0 times larger than the geometric-mean concentrations discharged from the Akron Water Pollution Control Station. Decay rates of fecal bacteria measured in field studies in 1992 ranged from 0.0018 per hour to 0.0372 per hour for fecal coliform bacteria and from 0.0022 per hour to 0.0407 per hour for Escherichia coli. Most of the decay rates measured in June and August were significantly higher than decay rates measured in April and October. Results of field studies demonstrated that concentrations of fecal coliform bacteria were 1.2 to 58 times higher in streambed sediments than in the overlying water. Sediments are likely to be a relatively less important source of fecal bacteria during rainfall and runoff in the middle main stem relative to bacterial loading from point sources. Numerical streamflow and transport simulation models were calibrated and verified with data collected during field studies. Of the constituents modeled, bacteria exhibited the poorest correspondence between observed and simulated values. The simulation results for a dye tracer indicated that the model reasonably reproduced the timing of dissolved constituents as well as dilution and dispersion effects. Calibrated and verified models for 1991 and 1992 data sets were used to simulate the improvements to bacteriological water quality that might result from reductions in concentrations of fecal bacteria discharged from two major sources. The model simulation resulting in the greatest improvement in bacteriological water-quality was one in which concentrations of fecal coliform bacteria and Escherichia coli were reduced by 90 percent in the Cuyahoga River at the Old Portage gaging station, and to geometric-mean bathing-water standards in the effluent of the Akron Water Pollution Control Station (BWS/90 scenario). Compared to the results of the base-simulation, when the BWS/90 scenario was applied in the 1991 model simulation, Escherichia coli concentrations were reduced 98.5 percent at Botzum, 97.5 percent at Jaite, and 91.1 percent at Independence. For 1992 model simulations, similar percent reductions in the concentrations of Escherichia coli were predicted at the three stream sites when the same reductions were applied to sources. None of the model simulations resulted in attainment of bacteriological water-quality standards.},

	annote = {Life-threatening infectious diseases associated with recreational water exposure are possible but occur very rarely. About eighty per cent of all infections due to bathing water produced gastroenteritis, the remaining were spontaneously healing infections of ear, nose and throat as well as eye and respiratory symptoms. They are caused by endogenic and exogenic agents. The risk, i.e. the mean frequency of such commonplace diseases associated with bathing or swimming is already doubled by endogenic infectious agents even without any etiological agents in the recreational water. The additional risk by exogenic infectious agents increases with the concentration of fecal markers. The prescribed limit E coli value of 200 CPU per 100 ml of the EU guidelines for bathing waters corresponds to a risk increased by the factor 7-8. The Bathing Water Committee of the German Federal Environmental Agency issued new recommendations prescribing severely lowered limit values. For example, the Committee called for 100 CPU of E. coli per 100 ml. However, there are economical and legal objections as well as doubts regarding the Committee's scientific competence. The lower limit values are associated with high expenses for communities and bathers without recognisable returns in terms of efficiency. Furthermore, they offend against the legal principle of equality because newly constructed pools are not different from bathing water regulated according to ED guidelines. Finally, the Bathing Water Committee holds scientifically incorrect views on infectious agents and on the risks in recreational waters. {\copyright}Georg Thieme Verlag.},

Predictive models, which would correlate information on land use change and development, would be useful so that downgrades in water quality can be predicted before they occur to allow effective land management decisions to be made. The approach used for this study involved a historical comparison of land use change and fecal coliform bacterial densities on Murrells Inlet (MI) (urbanized site) (n = 2026 samples) and North Inlet (NI) (pristine site) (n = 1656 samples), both bar-built estuaries located on the northern coast of South Carolina south of Myrtle Beach. The microbiological and water quality data used in this research covered the period of 1967-1995 and the following parameters were used: date of sampling, most probable number (MPN) of fecal coliform bacteria, salinity, rainfall and water temperature. The regression models used the above parameters and a change in trend term that accounted for both instantaneous and gradual changes in water quality that may arise from a particular environmental intervention. For MI, the 1980 environmental intervention consisted of the construction of a jetty and the conversion from septic tanks to a main sewer line of approximately 92{\%} of all residences. For NI, the 1973 and 1977 interventions were the construction of Baruch Laboratory and urban development of Debidue Island, respectively. For MI, the intervention, controlling for other environmental parameters, was found to be significant at the alpha = 0.05 level. There was a significant decrease in the increasing trend of fecal coliform bacteria for MI and the conversion to the sewage collection system had a beneficial effect on water quality and probably dominated the jetty effect. For NI, the laboratory construction had no overall impact on water quality so background natural sources of bacteria probably masked any small increases from human sources.},

Currently, there is no universal standard for sample collection and analysis or results interpretation. Monitoring policies are developed by individual beach management jurisdictions, and applications are highly variable across and within lakes, states, and provinces. Extensive research has demonstrated that sampling decisions for time, depth, number of replicates, frequency of sampling, and laboratory analysis all influence the results outcome, as well as calculations of the mean and interpretation of the results in policy decisions. Additional shortcomings to current monitoring approaches include appropriateness and reliability of currently used indicator bacteria and the overall goal of these monitoring programs. Current research is attempting to circumvent these complex issues by developing new tools and methods for beach monitoring. In this review, we highlight the variety of sampling routines used across the Great Lakes and the extensive body of research that challenges comparisons among beaches. We also assess the future of Great Lakes monitoring and the advantages and disadvantages of establishing standards that are evenly applied across all beaches.},

	annote = {To understand the fate and movement of Escherichia coli in beach water, numerous modeling studies have been undertaken including mechanistic predictions of currents and plumes and empirical modeling based on hydrometeorological variables. Most approaches are limited in scope by nearshore currents or physical obstacles and data limitations; few examine the issue from a larger spatial scale. Given the similarities between variables typically included in these models, we attempted to take a broader view of E. coli fluctuations by simultaneously examining twelve beaches along 35 km of Indiana's Lake Michigan coastline that includes five point-source outfalls. The beaches had similar E. coli fluctuations, and a best-fit empirical model included two variables: wave height and an interactive term comprised of wind direction and creek turbidity. Individual beach R2 was 0.32-0.50. Data training-set results were comparable to validation results (R2 = 0.48). Amount of variation explained by the model was similar to previous reports for individual beaches. By extending the modeling approach to include more coastline distance, broader-scale spatial and temporal changes in bacteria concentrations and the influencing factors can be characterized. {\copyright}2008 American Chemical Society.},

The delivery of contaminants by multiple creeks greatly complicates understanding of the source contributions, especially when pollution might originate up- or down-coast of beaches. We studied two beaches along Lake Michigan that are located between two creek outfalls to determine the hydrometeorologic factors influencing near-shore microbiologic water quality and the relative impact of the creeks. The creeks continuously delivered water with high concentrations of Escherichia coli to Lake Michigan, and the direction of transport of these bacteria was affected by current direction. Current direction reversals were associated with elevated E. coli concentrations at Central Avenue beach. Rainfall, barometric pressure, wave height, wave period, and creek specific conductance were significantly related to E. coli concentration at the beaches and were the parameters used in predictive models that best described E. coli variation at the two beaches. Multiple inputs to numerous beaches complicates the analysis and understanding of the relative relationship of sources but affords opportunities for showing how these complex creek inputs might interact to yield collective or individual effects on beach water quality.},

Consequently, coastal ecosystems are at serious risk. Larger coastal populations and increasing development have led to increased loading of toxic substances, nutrients and pathogens with subsequent algal blooms, hypoxia, beach closures, and damage to coastal fisheries. Recent climate change has led to the rise in sea level with loss of coastal wetlands and saltwater intrusion into coastal aquifers. Coastal resources have traditionally been monitored on a stressor-by-stressor basis such as for nutrient loading or dissolved oxygen. To fully measure the complexities of coastal systems, we must develop a new set of ecologic indicators that span the realm of biological organization from genetic markers to entire ecosystems and are broadly applicable across geographic regions while integrating stressor types. We briefly review recent developments in ecologic indicators and emphasize the need for improvements in understanding of stress-response relationships, contributions of multiple stressors, assessments over different spatial and temporal scales, and reference conditions. We provide two examples of ecologic indicators that can improve our understanding of these inherent problems: a) the use of photopigments as indicators of the interactive effects of nutrients and hydrology, and b) biological community approaches that use multiple taxa to detect effects on ecosystem structure and function. These indicators are essential to measure the condition of coastal resources, to diagnose stressors, to communicate change to the public, and ultimately to protect human health and the quality of the coastal environment.},

TVC 20$\,^{\circ}$C and TVC 37$\,^{\circ}$were used as the indicators of pollution, while TC, FC and FS - as indicators of sanitary state. Near-shore waters of Lake Wigry showed a little higher degree of pollution than pelagic waters. The waters of Lake Wigry showed higher bacteriological pollution in the region of bathing sites, the sailing harbour and the camping-site in Stary Folwark and in the northern part of this reservoir, the lower one was observed in the middle part, while the lowest one was in the western part in the region of Uklei and Wigierki Bays. Higher bacteriological pollution was found in near-shore waters of Lake Wigry in the end of June, 1994 and 1996 and at the beginning of September, 1995. In 1994 and 1996 it was caused mainly by the activity of water fowl (high number of FS), in 1995 by human recreational activity (high number of TC and FC). The majority of the examinated water samples of near-shore waters of Lake Wigry fulfilled the water conditions for recreation, including bathing.},

	isbn = {01411136},
	annote = {Fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) were measured approximately 5 days a week in ankle-depth water at 19 surfzone stations along Huntington Beach and Newport Beach, California, from 1998 to the end of 2003. These sampling periods span the time before and after treated sewage effluent, discharged into the coastal ocean from the local outfall, was disinfected. Bacterial samples were also taken in the vicinity of the outfall during the pre- and post-disinfection periods. Our analysis of the results from both data sets suggest that land-based sources, rather than the local outfall, were the source of the FIB responsible for the frequent closures and postings of local beaches in the summers of 2001 and 2002. Because the annual cycle is the dominant frequency in the fecal and total coliform data sets at most sampling stations, we infer that sources associated with local runoff were responsible for the majority of coliform contamination along wide stretches of the beach. The dominant fortnightly cycle in enterococci at many surfzone sampling stations suggests that the source for these relatively frequent bacteria contamination events in summer is related to the wetting and draining of the land due to the large tidal excursions found during spring tides. Along the most frequently closed section of the beach at stations 3N-15N, the fortnightly cycle is dominant in all FIBs. The strikingly different spatial and spectral patterns found in coliform and in enterococci suggest the presence of different sources, at least for large sections of beach. The presence of a relatively large enterococci fortnightly cycle along the beaches near Newport Harbor indicates that contamination sources similar to those found off Huntington Beach are present, though not at high enough levels to close the Newport beaches. {\copyright}2006 Elsevier Ltd.

	annote = {A regional survey of the microbiological water quality along the shoreline of the Southern California Bight (SCB), from Point Conception south to Ensenada, Mexico, was conducted during August, 1998, by 36 agencies under the coordination of the Southern California Coastal Water Research Project (SCCWRP). Microbiological water quality was assessed by calculating the percentage of shoreline-mile-days that exceeded bacterial indicator thresholds for total and fecal coliforms, total/fecal ratios, and enterococci. Sample sites were selected using a stratified random sampling approach, with the SCB recreational shoreline divided into six strata: high- and low-use sandy beaches, high- and low-use rocky shoreline, and perennial and ephemeral freshwater outlets. Samples were collected on a weekly basis at a total of 253 sites, beginning on August 2(nd), 1998 and continuing for five weeks. Samples were analyzed by 22 participating labs using their normal methods (multiple tube fermentation, membrane filtration, Colilert{\textregistered}and/or Enterolert{\textregistered}). All labs met testing criteria established through intercalibration exercises and quality control check samples distributed during the sampling period. Nearly 95{\%} of the shoreline-mile days did not exceed daily and monthly bacterial indicator thresholds, demonstrating good bacteriological water quality along the SCB shoreline. Freshwater outlets, comprised mainly of storm drains, had the poorest water quality with 60{\%} and 40{\%} of the shoreline-miles exceeding monthly and daily thresholds, respectively. Freshwater outlets were also more likely to demonstrate exceedances by multiple indicators at a single site, and repeat exceedances at sites over the five-week period. Compared with the southern California beaches, Mexican beaches had nearly 5 times the number of exceedances for total and fecal coliforms, and nearly 8 times the number of exceedances for total/fecal ratios.},

	annote = {Monitoring of recreational beaches for fecal indicator bacteria is currently performed using culture-based technology that can require more than a day for laboratory analysis, during which time swimmers are at risk. Here we review new methods that have the potential to reduce the measurement period to less than an hour. These methods generally involve two steps. The first is target capture, in which the microbial group of interest (or some molecular/chemical/or biochemical signature of the group) is removed, tagged or amplified to differentiate it from the remaining material in the sample. We discuss three classes of capture methods: 1) Surface and whole-cell recognition methods, including immunoassay techniques and molecule-specific probes; 2) Nucleic acid methods, including polymerase chain reaction (PCR), quantitative PCR (Q-PCR), nucleic acid sequence based amplification (NASBA) and microarrays; and 3) Enzyme/substrate methods utilizing chromogenic or fluorogenic substrates. The second step is detection, in which optical, electrochemical or piezoelectric technologies are used to quantify the captured, tagged or amplified material. The biggest technological hurdle for all of these methods is sensitivity, as EPA's recommended bathing water standard is less than one cell per ml and most detection technologies measure sample volumes less than 1 ml. This challenge is being overcome through addition of preconcentration or enrichment steps, which have the potential to boost sensitivity without the need to develop new detector technology. The second hurdle is demonstrating a relationship to health risk, since most new methods are based on measuring cell structure without assessing viability and may not relate to current water quality standards that were developed in epidemiology studies using culture-based methods. Enzyme/substrate methods may be the first rapid methods adopted because they are based on the same capture technology as currently-approved EPA methods and their relationship to health risk can be established by demonstrating equivalency to existing procedures. Demonstration of equivalency may also be possible for some surface and whole-cell recognition methods that capture bacteria in a potentially viable state. Nucleic acid technologies are the most versatile, but measure nonviable structure and will require inclusion in epidemiological studies to link their measurement with health risk.},

To assess comparability of these methods, quantify within-laboratory variability for each method, and place that variability into context of variability among laboratories using the same method, 22 southern California laboratories participated in a series of intercalibration exercises. Each laboratory processed three to five replicates from thirteen samples, with total coliforms, fecal coliforms or enterococci measured depending on the sample. Results were generally comparable among methods, though membrane filtration appeared to underestimate the other two methods for fecal coliforms, possibly due to clumping. Variability was greatest for the multiple tube fermentation method. For all three methods, within laboratory variability was greater than among laboratories variability.},

A suite of fecal steroids, including coprostanol (COP), epicoprostanol (eCOP), cholesterol (CHOE), cholestanol (CHOA), α-cholestanone (aONE), β-cholestanone (bONE), β-sitosterol (bSIT), stigmasterol (STIG), stigmastanol (STAN), and campesterol (CAM), were used as chemical markers to examine whether sewage was a significant source of FIB within the lower Santa Ana River watershed. A total of 54 water samples were collected from three locations in the intertidal zone near the mouth of the Santa Ana River at different tidal stages. Steroid ratios in SAR samples were different from those found in raw and treated sewage from a local wastewater treatment plant or in nearby effluent plume and did not appear to be influenced by the sampling location, daily tides, and spring/neap tidal cycle. The characteristics of steroid ratios suggested a diagenetic rather than a biogenic source for the COP content of the samples. The log-based concentrations of COP and FIB in the SAR samples were not significantly correlated, inconsistent with sewage being the source of FIB in the study area. In addition, multivariate statistical analysis showed that the concentrations of FIB were better correlated with bird fecal steroids than with the typical sewage sterols. The results implied that sewage was not a significant source of fecal steroids, and therefore perhaps FIB to the study area. Instead, birds may be one possible source of the intermittently high levels of FIB observed in the lower Santa Ana River watershed and the nearby surf zone.},

Interpolation of concentration of hydrophobic compounds, chlorophyll and bacterial cells in seawater over the geography of the sampling area using geographic information systems techniques (GIS) allowed the delineation of two different habitats: bay and marina (with low and high levels of impact respectively), and a transition zone between them. Accordingly, the 16S rDNA T-RFLP profiles of bacterial communities in the area differed mainly spatially, with gradual changes in community composition and structure when approaching the beach and marina. Bacterial communities in impacted areas had higher diversity and equitability, as well as different composition. The main bacterial populations inferred in bay samples, which were members of the Alphaproteobacteria (mainly SAR11 and Roseobacter groups), were replaced by a different population of the Roseobacter clade, and members of the Gammaproteobacteria and Bacteroidetes in more impacted areas. There were also differences in the dynamics of bacterial communities. While temporal variations in bacterial communities in bay samples were lower and mainly determined by temperature, an important factor for the functioning of this ecosystem, variation in impacted areas was more irregular, not so much temperature-driven, and in the case of the transition zone (beach) reflected the use of the coast during warmer periods. {\copyright}2007 The Authors.},

Rotifers were sampled from three lakes located near the city of Poznan (Poland). To detect the oocysts of Cryptosporidium, we applied the fluorescent in situ hybridisation technique, an immunofluorescent assay and an enzyme immunoassay. Oocysts of Cryptosporidium were detected both in water collected from the lakes and in rotifers. The FISH technique applied to rotifers enabled the detection of biological contamination of surface water through an assessment of the dispersive stages of the parasite and was found to be more sensitive, less time-consuming and cheaper than the method recommended by the USEPA.},

	annote = {Conducting polymers for battery applications have been subject to numerous investigations during the last two decades. However, the functional charging rates and the cycling stabilities have so far been found to be insufficient for practical applications. These shortcomings can, at least partially, be explained by the fact that thick layers of the conducting polymers have been used to obtain sufficient capacities of the batteries. In the present letter, we introduce a novel nanostructured high-surface area electrode material for energy storage applications composed of cellulose fibers of algal origin individually coated with a 50 nm thin layer of polypyrrole. Our results show the hitherto highest reported charge capacities and charging rates for an all polymer paper-based battery. The composite conductive paper material is shown to have a specific surface area of 80 m2 g−1 and batteries based on this material can be charged with currents as high as 600 mA cm−2 with only 6{\%} loss in capacity over 100 subsequent charge and discharge cycles. The aqueous-based batteries, which are entirely based on cellulose and polypyrrole and exhibit charge capacities between 25 and 33 mAh g−1 or 38−50 mAh g−1 per weight of the active material, open up new possibilities for the production of environmentally friendly, cost efficient, up-scalable and lightweight energy storage systems.},

A review of the potential for diffuse urban sources includes consideration of sewage pollution in surface water sewers, as well as non-human sources such as pigeon and other bird roosts, and faecal material from pets such as dogs and cats. Portobello beach in Edinburgh is the case study selected, because of earlier work done by Scottish Water and SEPA. The Figgate Burn crosses Edinburgh to discharge onto the beach at Portabello, and pollution sources in its catchment are described. Additional information is reported from Dunfermline, where the sewer network has provided examples of three ways in which sewage pollution can occur in urban streams, and also Scottish examples of measures to control some non-human sources (e.g. SUDS). {\copyright}IWA Publishing 2005.},

Anaerobic-MF reduced presumptive FS and background bacterial counts by 2 to 5 orders of magnitude, increased proportions of FS verification in 54 of the 80 samples, but conferred no obvious advantage in the FC counts. 94 to 100{\%} of blue colonies on MFC agar in 24 hr aerobic- and anaerobic-MF cultures were confirmed as FC. Presumptive and background bacteria in FS counts, proportions of verified FS, and presumptive FC counts correlated with one another. The MF and most probable number (MPN) methods were compared. In a modified MPN confirmation, cultivation of FS colonies in Brain heart infusion agar prior to esculin hydrolysis test gave substantially higher counts than anaerobic-MF at three stations. The overall FS and FC data apparently indicate only low contamination levels occur. Beaches exceeding the region's quality (USEPA) standards are associated with municipal wastewate outfalls.},

Based on the sources and visual estimate of the amount of bulk pollutant, the rivers were grouped into three zones, A,B,C; the quantity of bulk residue as pollutants on the rivers varied in decreasing sequence B>C>A>, but the zonal differences in temperature, pH, NH super(+) sub(4), NO super(-) sub(3) and PO super(-) sub(4) were not significant. Eighty to one hundred percent of colonies from the MF and MPN were confirmed as faecal streptococci (FS). River sample FS count/100 ml. on KF ranged from 8 (Station 1, Zone A) to 681 (Station 11, zone B) at 45 degree C, and from 26 (Station 2, zone A) to 1341 (Station 6, zone B) at 37 degree C. The overall FS populations in river samples varied in decreasing number in the sequence: B>A>C>. These data show that the water sources are grossly faecally polluted at many stations; 11 of them exceed, some by factor of up to 16, the 33 FS cells/100 ml. limit internationally accepted for recreational waters. Biochemical tests on 643 strains showed that 640 tolerated 6.5{\%} NaCl, pH 9.6 and 40{\%} bile; only 32 and 89 respectively grew at 10 degree and 45 degree C; the information was not sufficient to enable strain separation into FS subgroups.},

The 2 beaches showed predominance of Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium, in the water and the sand. Dry sand presented higher densities of Enterococcus sp. and higher frequency of resistant strains than wet sand and seawater. The beach with a higher degree of pollution presented higher percentages of resistant strains (66.7{\%} and 61.5{\%}, in sand and in water, respectively) and resistance to a larger number of antimicrobials compared with the less polluted beach, Ilha Porchat (35.7{\%} and 31.25{\%} of resistant strains in sand and water, respectively). In water samples, the highest frequencies of resistance were obtained against streptomycin (38.5{\%}) and erythromycin (25{\%}), whilst in sand, the highest frequencies were observed in relation to erythromycin and tetracycline (38.1{\%} and 14.3{\%}, respectively). These results show that water and sands from beaches with high indexes of faecal contamination of human origin may be potential sources of contamination by pathogens and contribute to the dissemination of bacterial resistance. {\copyright}2007 Elsevier Ltd.

In two cohort studies, illness was significantly associated with drinking municipal water (town residents: adjusted odds ratio=10.1, 95% confidence intervals [CI]=1.8-56.4; visitors attending family reunion: relative risk=9.0, 95% CI=1.3- 63.3). The unchlorinated water supply had microbiologic evidence of fecal organisms and the potential for chronic contamination with surface water. Among persons exposed to water, the attack rate was significantly lower in town residents than in visitors (23% vs. 50%, p<0.01) and decreased with increasing age. The lower attack rate among exposed residents, especially adults, is consistent with the acquisition of partial immunity following long-term exposure. Serologic data, although limited, may support this finding. Contamination of small, unprotected water systems may be an increasing public health risk.},

A large watershed that drains an urbanized area with treatment plants that release raw sewage during storms discharges into Lake Michigan at the outlet of Burns Ditch. A small watershed drains part of the Great Marsh, a wetland complex that has been disrupted by ditching and limited residential development, at the outlet of Derby Ditch. Monitoring at the outlet of Burns Ditch in 1999 and 2000 indicated that E. coli concentrations vary over two orders of magnitude during storms. During one storm, sewage overflows caused concentrations to increase to more than 10,000 cfu/100 mL for several hours. Monitoring at Derby Ditch from 1997 to 2000 also indicated that E. coli concentrations increase during storms with the highest concentrations generally occurring during rising streamflow. Multiple regression analysis indicated that 60{\%} of the variability in measured outflows of E. coli from Derby Ditch (n = 88) could be accounted for by a model that utilizes continuously measured rainfall, stream discharge, soil temperature and depth to water table in the Great Marsh. A similar analysis indicated that 90{\%} of the variability in measured E. coli concentrations at the outlet of Burns Ditch (n = 43) during storms could be accounted for by a combination of continuously measured water-quality variables including nitrate and ammonium. These models, which utilize data that can be collected on a real-time basis, could form part of an Early Warning System for predicting beach closures.},

A wide range of hydrological, meteorological, and water quality variables were evaluated as possible predictive variables. These included wind speed and direction, incoming solar radiation (insolation), various time frames of rainfall, air temperature, lake stage and wave height, and water temperature, specific conductance, dissolved oxygen, pH, and turbidity. The best-fit model combined real-time measurements of wind direction and speed (onshore component of resultant wind vector), rainfall, insolation, lake stage, water temperature and turbidity to predict the geometric mean E. coli concentration in the swimming zone of the beach. The model, which contained both additive and multiplicative (interaction) terms, accounted for 71{\%} of the observed variability in the log E. coli concentrations. A comparison between model predictions of when the beach should be closed and when the actual bacterial concentrations were above or below the 235 cfu 100 ml(-1) threshold value, indicated that the model accurately predicted openings versus closures 88{\%} of the time.},

The aims of these phases were to determine levels of parasite contamination in raw water samples collected from the intakes as well as from other sites in each watershed and to investigate cattle in the watersheds as potential sources of parasite contamination of surface drinking water supplies. Giardia cysts were not detected in the raw water samples collected from lake sources at the headwaters of both watersheds but were found in 100% (70 of 70) of water samples collected at the BMID intake and 97% (68 of 70) of water samples collected at the VID intake. Significantly higher levels (P < 0.05) of Giardia cysts were found at the BMID intake (phase 1, 7 to 2,215 cysts per 100 liters; phase 3, 4.6 to 1,880 cysts per 100 liters) when compared with that of the VID intake (2 to 114 cysts per 100 liters). The BMID watershed has a more complex system of surface water sources than the VID watershed. Cattle have access to creeks in the BMID watershed, whereas access is restricted in the VID watershed. Collection of raw water samples from a creek upstream and downstream of a cattle ranch in the BMID watershed showed that the downstream location had significantly higher (P < 0.05) levels (0.6 to 42.9 cysts per 100 liters and 1.4 to 300.0 oocysts per 100 liters) of both Giardia cysts and Cryptosporidium oocysts than those of the upstream location (0.5 to 34.4 cysts per 100 liters and 0.5 to 34.4 oocysts per 100 liters). Peak concentrations of both parasites coincided with calving activity. Fecal samples, collected from cattle in both watersheds, showed 10% (3 of 30) in the BMID and 50% (5 of 10) in the VID watersheds to be Giardia positive. No Cryptosporidium-positive fecal samples were found. Giardia cysts isolated from the BMID watershed were repeatedly infective to gerbils in contrast to those from the VID watershed. The 10 BMID drinking water Giardia isolates retrieved into culture and biotyped showed zymodeme and karyotype heterogeneity. The differences in patterns of parasite contamination and cattle management practices contribute to the unique watershed characteristics observed between two areas which are topographically similar and geographically adjacent.},

Pilot-scale bioaerosol reactor experiments that independently measure the solar and nonsolar \~{}absence of solar radiation! inactivation rates of airborne Mycobacterium parafortuitum and Escherichia coli were performed. Direct fluorescent microscopy measurements for total airborne bacteria and culture-based assays were used to measure concentrations in a 1 m3 aerosol reactor that was transparent to UV-A and UV-B wavelengths, and to produce decay curves of airborne bacteria under moderate \~{}50--60{\%}! and high \~{}85--95{\%}! levels of relative humidity \~{}RH!. E. coli was more susceptible to airborne decay than M. parafortuitum at all RH levels tested. RH strongly influenced solar and nonsolar airborne inactivation rates in both bacteria. These inactivation rates for both bacteria were greatest at moderate RH levels.},

This study used polymerase chain reaction, direct fluorescent-antibody staining, and culture methods to examine raw and treated sewage, ocean-receiving waters, and nearshore coastal environments for the presence of Legionella pneumophila and other Legionella spp. The study concluded that Legionella spp. are present in all phases of sewage treatment and that population numbers do not significantly decline through the treatment process. Ocean-receiving waters located 5 miles offshore, where the treated sewage is discharged, were found to contain Legionella spp., but ocean water between the discharge site and coastal bathing beaches was negative. This suggests that the Legionella spp. from the ocean discharge site were not reaching the nearshore beach waters. A flood control channel and river that entered the ocean were found to contain Legionella spp., and a nearby beach swimming area was also found to be positive, suggesting that land runoff from the flood control channel and river were the source of the Legionella spp. in the beach water samples that tested positive.}

We performed a premarketing evaluation of the Colilert-MW product, testing it in parallel with the multiple tube fermentation (MTF) method for 86 coastal water samples in southern California. Statistical analysis was performed by using paired t tests and linear regression. Bacterial isolates were evaluated by biochemical and genetic analysis. The results of this study showed a strong correlation between the traditional MTF and the Colilert-MW method for detection of total coliforms (r = 0.95) and E. coli (r = 0.89) in ocean water samples. Paired t-test results indicated that the Colilert-MW and MTF were equivalent in detecting E. coli and that the Colilert-MW may be more sensitive in the detection of total coliforms. We conclude that Colilert-MW would be a useful tool with which to monitor coastal beach water.},

This data included local bathymetry, currents, dispersion, fecal coliform mortality rates, winds, receiving water fecal coliform densities, and discharge pollutographs. Specially designed field fecal coliform surveys were required to calibrate and verify the model since the storm effects are very dynamic in both time and space. The verified model was then used to estimate the reduction in fecal coliform densities at the beaches for different intensity storms for different remedial works. The improvements resulting from the different remedial works were quantified as the number of hours when the fecal coliform densities exceeded 100 counts/dL.},

The study was undertaken as a public health investigation as Lake Nainital is visited by more than 100,000 tourists each year and has a local population of 30,000. The raw water of this lake is used for domestic supplies as well as for recreational purposes by tourists and residents. The coliform count of entire lake water showed a distinct seasonal variation. The highest value of coliforms was observed during the rainy season while it was lowest in the winter months. It is believed that during the monsoon months the surface water drained from the surrounding areas of the lake probably added additional waste water from human habitation which could be the main cause for the high coliform count of lake water during the rainy season. This increase was probably due to increased human or animal activity. While there are no Indian Standards for recreational water quality, it is recommended that the total coliform count of 1000 and 5000/100 ml be the limiting values for contact and noncontact recreational waters, respectively, and that the corresponding values of 150 and 750/100 ml for E. coli be established for assessing the probable exposure to pathogenic organisms. The present high values of coliforms and E. coli of Nainital Lake could be considered a direct health menace, particularly in the summer season. (Baker-FRC)},

Modelling results suggest that the minimal setback distances were 16 m to satisfy the New Zealand Recreational Water Quality Guidelines for E. coli <126 per 100 ml (Ministry for the Environment, 1999) and 48 m to meet the Drinking-Water Standards for New Zealand 2000 for enteric virus <1 per 100 l (Ministry of Health, 2000). These distances may be applicable for other lakeshores in pumice sand aquifers with groundwater velocities <7 m/day. Findings of laboratory column and batch experiments provided an insight into the microbial attenuation and transport processes in pumice sand aquifers. Bacterial removal was predominately through filtration (87-88{\%}) and partially by die-off (12-13{\%}), while viral removal was by both die-off (45{\%}) and filtration (55{\%}). In addition, microbial die-off in groundwater without aquifer material (i.e. free microbes) was much lower than die-off in groundwater with aquifer material (i.e. sorbed microbes) and contributed only 2-6{\%} to the total removal. This implies that the setback distances estimated from die-off rates for the free microbes, determined in the laboratory without considering aquifer media and other removal processes, which are often reported in the literature, could be larger than necessary.},

	annote = {At Italian-Russian International Conference on "R{\^o}le of the University on ecological education and training", was illustrate six topics of 30 years of our scientific and didactic activity on Environmental Hygiene, here below summarized: I. At first time, sludges of biological treatment plants and domestic sewage were frequently utilized under bacteriological control as economical and ecological fertilizers of land and waters. At present such a custom is very rare owing the chemical pollution of sewage continuously increasing; but in some countries it is still in use, and is our opinion and experience that organic waste material must be reused as fertilizer of land, more and more devoid of humus and subject to erosion of winds and waters. Some treatment plants are shown, and related plankton pyramid's. II. Pilot sewage treatment plants are frequently used in our experiments and training, for study and control of the biological degradation of organic matter, for evaluate the disappearance rate of bacteria and viruses, for investigate the foric action and behaviour of chemical and radioactive pollutants, for quantify their accumulation in the sludges of sewage treatment plants, and so forth. Different pilot plants are used, located both in our laboratories both in industries; in nuclear power plant are tested at the same time 3 models of 3 different plants (biodiscs, activated sludges, biofiltering channels), working with prevalent algal growth. III. Many species of microorganisms (metazoa, protozoa, algae, fungi, bacteria, viruses and new species like Bdellovibrio) are present in aerobic sewage treatment plants (activated sludge, bacterial bed, biodiscs, lagooning, etc.); in anaerobic treatment (digesters) prevail only methane-producing bacteria. Some of these organisms are very abundant and very active as consumers of organic matter; others are characteristic indicators of well balanced purification or of bad purification owing acute variation of organic load or presence of toxic substances in sewage. Many strains are antibiotic-producing, or Vit. B12 producing; others explain a strong lytic activity or are neuraminidase-formers. Production of great amount of biofloculant polysaccharides useful on sedimentation of organic matter is enhanced by adding particular organic pollutants like distillery wastes and others. Sewage treatment plants are good means for scientific research of particular biota continuously available and for food microbiological training for students and technicians on pathogens present in treated and untreated sewage and in sludges. IV. Big fecal pollution of coastal waters is clearly dangerous because of bathing beaches, shellfish farming, bacterial aerosols, damage to marine biota, eutrofication, aesthetic problems.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)}

One discharges primary treated sewage and the other discharges secondary treated sewage but are otherwise similar. This enabled comparisons of the effects of these different levels of treatment on the water quality and algal productivity of receiving waters. Plumes were followed and repeatedly sampled in a time-series manner. Rhodamine dye was used as a conservative tracer to compare the dilution behavior of the plume constituents MRP, NO3+NO2, NH4, Silicate, TDP, TDN, total bacteria, PC, and PN. Rates of initial dilution ranged from two to almost three orders of magnitude, and were in reasonable agreement with engineering model predictions. Dilution of plume constituents approximated that of Rhodamine until background concentrations were reached, typically within 10 min of discharge. Chl a concentrations did not increase through time in the primary sewage plume but did increase up to 30{\%} in the secondary sewage plume. However, rates of far-field dilution were so rapid that the increase could not have been due to algal growth. The increase was attributed to the plume mixing with a water mass whose relative chl a concentrations were greater. Rates of secondary dilution ranged from 2 to 3 orders of magnitude resulting in total dilutions of 105-106 within 3 h of discharge. These rates of secondary dilution were much greater than model predictions. From a nutrient standpoint, secondary treatment exhibited no advantages over primary treatment because dilutions were so rapid. {\copyright}2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The aggregate losses on Padre Island were highest on weekend days in July estimated at $171,000 per day of closure (2001$). They were lowest on weekdays in September at $25,000. Per trip losses were about $28. A similar closure of beaches near Galveston resulted in losses of $263,000 (week day) and $852,000 (weekend day) with a per trip loss of $30.},

Becker \& Associates Ltd. was retained in 1985 to research and develop a functional design for a swim basin that will be formed by cordoning off an area of the Detroit River with a breakwater. A unique feature of this breakwater is that it is being designed to filter water from the Detroit River to the extent required for safe swimming. When it is constructed in 1988, it will be capable of accommodating approximately 1500 swimmers. Extensive hydraulic model studies were carried out at the universities of Windsor and Michigan to research and develop a functional design for this facility. The methodology used to develop the design concepts for this swim basin as well as the results of the testing program are described in this paper. -Authors},

During the twentieth century, the frequency of major storms has already increased, and the total precipitation increase over this time period has primarily come from the greater number of heavy events. The Great Lakes region is projected to experience a rise these extreme precipitation events. For southern Wisconsin, the precipitation rate of the 10 wettest days was simulated using a suite of seven global climate models from the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fourth Assessment Report. For each ranking, the precipitation rate of these very heavy events increases in the future. Overall, the models project that extreme precipitation events will become 10% to 40% stronger in southern Wisconsin, resulting in greater potential for flooding, and for the waterborne diseases that often accompany high discharge into Lake Michigan. Using 6.4 cm (2.5 in) of daily precipitation as the threshold for initiating combined sewer overflow into Lake Michigan, the frequency of these events is expected to rise by 50% to 120% by the end of this century. The combination of future thermal and hydrologic changes may affect the usability of recreational beaches. Chicago beach closures are dependent on the magnitude of recent precipitation (within the past 24 hours), lake temperature, and lake stage. Projected increases in heavy rainfall, warmer lake waters, and lowered lake levels would all be expected to contribute to beach contamination in the future. The Great Lakes serve as a drinking water source for more than 40 million people. Ongoing studies and past events illustrate a strong connection between rain events and the amount of pollutants entering the Great Lakes. Extreme precipitation under global warming projections may overwhelm the combined sewer systems and lead to overflow events that can threaten both human health and recreation in the region.},

	annote = {Viral tracer studies have been used previously to study the potential for wastewater contamination of surface marine waters in the Upper and Middle Florida Keys. Two bacteriophages, the marine bacteriophage φHSIC and the Salmonella phage PRD1, were used as tracers in injection well and septic tank studies in Saddlebunch Keys of the Lower Florida Keys and in septic tank studies in Boot Key Harbor, Marathon, of the Middle Keys. In Boot Key Harbor, both phages were detected in a canal adjacent to the seeded septic tank within 3 h 15 min of the end of the seed period. The tracer was then detected at all sampling sites in Boot Key Harbor, including one on the opposite side of U.S. Highway 1 in Florida Bay, and at an Atlantic Ocean beach outside Boot Key Harbor. Rates of migration based on first appearance of the phage ranged from 1.7 to 57.5 m h-1. In Saddlebunch Keys, φHSIC and PRD1 were used to seed a residential septic tank and a commercial injection well. The septic tank tracer was not found in any surface water samples. The injection well tracer was first detected at a site most distant from the seed site, a channel that connected Sugarloaf Sound with the Atlantic Ocean. The rate of tracer migration from the injection well to this channel ranged from 66.8 to 141 m-1. Both tracer studies showed a rapid movement of wastewater from on-site sewage treatment and disposal systems in a southeasterly direction toward the reef tract and Atlantic Ocean, with preferential movement through tidal channels. These studies indicate that wastewater disposal systems currently in widespread use in the Florida Keys can rapidly contaminate the marine environment.},

Summary results of a survey of 400 randomly chosen households in Los Angeles County are given. Respondents were asked about their beach use and perceptions of environmental quality: both coastal water quality and air quality.

Eight water quality parameters are reviewed using data collected from 1994 to 1999 in the Rouge River. Currently, five of the eight parameters in the Rouge River including bacteria, biochemical oxygen demand, and total suspended solids (TSS) exceed the required water quality standards. The reported analysis of structural BMP efficiencies reveals that structural BMPs appear capable of reducing only some of the pollutants of concern to acceptable levels.},

Such a unit is the first of this type in France. The installation is described. The disinfection guarantees are an outflow the germ concentration of which should be below 200 Escherichia coli/100 ml geometric average over 30 days, and below 2000 E. coli 100{\%} of the time. The results obtained from 1 June to 3 October are specified. The disinfection performance was highly satisfactory: the mean residual Escherichia coli and faecal streptococcus values were 43 and 42 germs/100 ml for kills of 3.2 and 2.8 u.log. The disinfection guarantees have never been exceeded. In particular, only 2 samples out of 58 taken showed an E. coli concentration after UV greater than 1,000 germs/100 ml. The UV transmission (T) of the effluent varied from 35 to 63{\%} as a consequence of the station's output increase. The least satisfactory results were recorded during periods of lower {\%} UV T. During the 4 months of the study, three acid washes were carried out of the quartz sleeves: the speed at which the UV system used at Le Portel (low pressure UV lamps in an open channel) is contaminated is thus low.},

All sewage (to the major part raw domestic sewage, to a lesser extent sewage of industrial origin) flows into its harbour, causing a daily inflow of ca. one part of sewage per 100 parts of harbour water. This heavy pollution load causes significant physico-chemical and biological consequences. 2. The number of "estuarine" bacteria has increased enormously due to the great daily input of organic matter. The number of coliform bacteria is high; it decreases towards the seaward entrance of the harbour. 3. The beach in the small vicinity of the harbour is polluted. 4. The harbour water contains low amounts of dissolved oxygen; its transparency is reduced resulting in poor or in non-existent phyto-plankton production. 5. The number of zooplankton species decreases from the outer- to the inner parts of the harbour. 6. The benthos consists of black, completely anoxic mud which strongly smells of sulfides; its content of organic matter is much higher than that of sediments in the open sea. 7. Rich development of a typical "Aufwuchs" biocoenosis which thrives on the richness in organic matter of the water. 8.

	annote = {The island of Sylt is one of the most important recreation centres in the German part of the southern North Sea. As in other islands, the sewage of its several villages is led directly into the sea area ("Wattenmeer") between the island and the continental coast. During 1967 and 1968 the author examined whether there occurs any sewage pollution at the beaches of the open sea coast of Sylt. In order to estimate the water quality for bathing, the sanitary water control in Germany conventionally determines certain chemical qualities as well as the general number of bacteria and the coli-titre of the water samples. Around the island of Sylt testing of 225 samples revealed that the upper limit of the bacteria number and of the coli-titre is not reached, neither at the open sea beach (bathing site), nor at the "Wattenmeer" coast, except in narrow districts left and right of the sewage outlets of the four sewage plants. By comparing the coli-titre of samples taken synchronously at different points of the coast, it was found that there is obviously a tidal drift of sewage-contaminated waters from the "Wattenmeer" to the open sea beach. Seasonal differences exist between general bacteria number and concentration of coli bacteria. It is concluded that the general number of bacteria depends on the concentration of organic matter in the water, while the absolute number of sewage bacteria can be estimated by means of the coli-titre only. The capacity of self-purification of sea water manifests itself in the abundance of its bacteria (mostly endemic marine forms). Bacterium coli and the coliform bacteria, however, are real sewage bacteria; their numbers must be carefully checked, since they indicate that human pathogenic bacteria may be present in the water as well. {\copyright}1970 Biologischen Anstalt Helgoland.},

	annote = {Introduction. The aims of this study are to assess the quality of the coastal waters of central-northern Sardinia through data from a monitoring network and to outline maps and experimental models of environmental risk correlated to the presence of chemical and microbiological contaminants. The area studied is the coast between Capo Falcone and the mouth of the river Coghinas, in the northwestern part of the island. Methods. In a first phase, 7 sampling stations of sea water and I sampling station of bivalve molluscs (Mytilus galloprovincialis Lam.) were identified. For each transept 3 different collection points at respectively 500, 1000, and 3000 meters from the coast for a total 21 sampling sites were identified. In a second phase, another 7 transepts were identified, 2 of which on the island of Asinara. Results. As regards the microbiological monitoring of the sea water, very low concentrations of Total coliforms, Faecal coliforms and Faecal Streptococci were found and no Salmonella were isolated. Chemical analysis of the waters showed a high constant presence of phenols. In the bivalves we found rather high concentrations of Faecal coliforms without any clear seasonal variation, while no Salmonella was isolated in any of the examined samples. Discussion. The results show that the considered area is not affected by serious pollution processes, thus allowing to express a completely satisfactory judgement on its state of health. However, anthropic pressure in the considered territory is testified by the presence in the water of high concentrations of phenols. Conclusions. The results point out to the necessity of targeted and rational preventive action by means of control and protection measures for environmental ecosytems.},

	annote = {Aims: This paper evaluates the presence of human pathogen micro-organisms in marine sediments in a coastal area suitable for bathing. In addition, the grain size analysis was performed in order to correlate the characteristics of the sediments and the microbial content. Methods and Results: The samples were collected in two small bays along the central Adriatic coast, where breakwaters had been built for the purpose of halting marine erosion. Faecal contamination indicators, Salmonella and Vibrio species, enteric viruses were investigated using standard techniques for isolation and identification. The grain size was determined using calibrated sieves and 'Sedigraph' device. In some samples, the faecal contamination indices overstepped legislative limits. Salmonella was never found. Vibrio and enteric viruses were isolated: the micro-organisms were preferentially abundant in fine sediments. Conclusions: Marine sediments can represent an important reservoir of allochthonous and marine microorganisms and the microbial charge correlates with the characteristics of the sediments. Significance and Impact of the Study: This study indicates that it is important to analyse marine sediments before defining the quality of coastal areas.},

Firstly, a 20 year hindcast of Lake Erie was used to find design storms by calculating the state of the receiving water. This study was done as part of the Great Lakes Forecasting System. Secondly, a nearshore model was developed to calculate the local flow fields in the Cleveland area. Lastly, the storm runoff was calculated using a series of models that describe the complex storm water runoff and combined sewer flow in the Cleveland area. These models include sewer models and receiving stream models. Eleven inflow sites from the local Cleveland area were included as sources of storm water discharges to Lake Erie. The nearshore model acted as the link between the land based models for inflows and the Lake Erie model. The nearshore model was driven by the lake model and was used to transport the inflows provided by the land based models. A series of experiments was designed to simulate various containment and treatment scenarios. The nearshore model calculated fecal coliform concentrations for three public beaches in the test area. The resulting concentration maps serve as a guideline for Cleveland CSO remediation design selection.},

All eight isolated physiological groups of bacteria were much more numerous in polluted than in unpolluted beach. In polluted beach, bacteria hydrolyzing uric acid (32.5 cells 103 g -1 dry w. of sand) and ammonifying bacteria (32.3 cells 10 3 g-1 dry w. of sand) were the most numerous, while nitrifying bacteria were the least numerous (0.014 cells 103 g -1 dry w. of sand). In unpolluted beach, bacteria hydrolyzing uric acid (0.66 cells 103 g-1 dry w. of sand) and reducing methylene blue (0.18 cells 103 g-1 dry w. of sand) were the most numerous, while no bacteria producing hydrogen sulphide from organic compounds or bacteria decomposing urea were isolated. In both beaches, considerable differentiation in the distribution of physiological groups of bacteria was found in a horizontal profile i.e. from the water-line to the middle of beach (∼60 m). Data concerning horizontal distribution of the physiological groups of bacteria in the sand of the polluted beach show that the majority of those groups was most numerous in the dune. No clear regularity in the distribution of physiological groups of bacteria was found in the horizontal profile of the unpolluted beach. Results of the present study indicate differences in the distribution of the physiological groups of bacteria in the surface (0-5 cm) and subsurface (5-10 cm) sand layers. Generally, in both studied beaches all physiological groups of bacteria were much more numerous in the surface than in the subsurface sand layer. The exception were bacteria reducing sulphates which in the polluted beach were most numerous at the depth of 5-10 cm.},

Thus, the presence of microorganisms - among then emerging pathogens - such as human enteric viruses (norovirus, astrovirus, rotavirus, hepatitis A virus), pathogenic bacteria (Salmonella, Listeria monocytogenes, Shiga-Toxi-Producing E. coli (STEC), Vibrio cholerae, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, etc.) has been reported in coastal areas. Those microorganisms have been implicated in gastrointestinal and respiratory illnesses and other infections (skin, eyes, etc.). Some of them, especially viruses, are responsible for shellfish-borne diseases. The recent development of innovative methods for identifying microorganisms and pathogens has allowed for the detection of new pathogens in the environment. Molecular techniques already used in clinical medicine are adapted for environment testing, assessing risks due to the dispersion of human pathogens in the sea. Thus, PCR, multiplex PCR, gene probes, and DNA fingerprinting techniques are now available to detect human enteric pathogens in seafood and seawater. Contrary to traditional detection and enumeration methods that were time-consuming, mono-specific and ineffective in generating adequate information regarding public health, these techniques are rapid, sensitive, specific and cost-effective.},

	annote = {Worldwide, the popularity of recreational activities which involve contact with water is continuing to grow. Moreover, ease of travel and change in human behaviour has altered the use of water for recreational purposes. Users should be aware that recreational exposures to pathogens may result in disease. Susceptible populations including people with reduced immune function (e.g., resulting from disease (cancer, HIV), genetic susceptibility, age, etc.) or lack of immunity to locally endemic diseases (e.g., tourists) may be at higher risk of contracting illnesses. In most cases the primary disease symptoms associated with recreational water contact are acute, such as diarrhoea and respiratory infections. Although less frequently reported, more serious and potentially fatal disease is a risk to recreational users of water especially in certain susceptible populations. In addition to diseases which have severe primary outcomes (e.g., primary amoebic meningoencephalitis, typhoid, leptospirosis), a number of infections may lead to sequelae with serious consequences including renal disease (from E. coli O157:H7 for example), cardiac and nutritional disorders. This is the first book to provide a comprehensive review and analysis of potential severe disease outcomes, including acute effects and sequelae, associated with recreational water activities. This book will be useful to all those concerned with recreational water quality, including environmental and public health professionals, local authorities, user groups, and tourists. Water Recreation and Disease sets out to identify the more severe waterborne diseases and their sequelae which may be acquired while undertaking water-based recreation in marine, freshwater, spas/whirlpools and swimming pools. The review systematically brings information together on the ecology and health aspects of a variety of pathogens where cases attributed to recreational use of water have been documented. This is the only available guide to bring together information on the more severe waterbome diseases to assist decision-making in recreational water management.

The novel approach of monitoring that combines risk assessment (water quality monitoring plus a sanitary survey) and risk management, as applied here, allows the identification of possible sources of pollution and the levels of microbiological risk that bathers are subject to.

The aim of the present study was to assess the impact of this measure. Lake bottom sediments were collected and analyzed for grain size, organic matter, organic carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, heavy metals and hydrophobic organic compounds to evaluate their concentration and spatial distribution. Our results demonstrate that, compared to results obtained before the outlet pipe prolongation, the surface area of highly contaminated sediments was reduced by one third after the pipe extension. However, contaminant concentrations are still high and the accumulation of pollutants may represent a significant source of toxicity for benthic organisms. One concludes that contaminant reduction at the source will be necessary for a further improvement. {\copyright}2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Of those, 1858 successfully completed a follow up interview conducted in seven days. Respiratory, gastrointestinal, eye, and ear symptoms, and fever occurring during the seven day follow up were recorded. Main results - A total of 136 participants (7.5{\%}) reported symptoms. Visitors reported experiencing symptoms with more frequency than residents. Incidence rates of gastrointestinal, cutaneous and high respiratory tract symptoms were higher in bathers, but the differences were not significant. Total symptoms were related with the amount of total coliforms, faecal coliforms, and faecal streptococci in the water. Gastrointestinal and skin symptoms kept a positive trend with the degree of water pollution by total coliforms in both crude and adjusted analyses. An increased risk was observed in 2500-9999 total coliforms per 100 ml, a figure over the proposed standard, although below the European Union mandatory limit.

In the study area near Yverdon-les-Bains, Switzerland, tracer tests proved connection between a sinking stream draining agricultural land and several springs, 4.8--6.3 km away. Tracing and monitoring results demonstrate that (i) suspended particles (turbidity) in the spring water either originate from remobilization of sediments inside the aquifer (autochthonous) or from the sinking stream and land surface (allochthonous); (ii) allochthonous turbidity coincides with increased E. coli and TOC levels; (iii) PSD makes it possible to distinguish the two types of turbidity; (iv) a relative increase of finer particles (0.9--10 μm) indicates allochthonous turbidity and thus possible fecal contamination. The method permits to optimize water treatment and identify periods when the spring water must be rejected. Findings from other test sites confirm the feasibility of this approach.},

In particular, the movement of a sand wave across the intertidal zone from low water to extinction at the foot of the dune system was observed. The more extensive fine sandy beach at Llanddona had greater stability. Chemically, each beach was variable both spatially and temporally, with ill-defined patterns of concentration changes. Sand from Newborough beach was low in organic carbon (0.07-0.40 mg C/g dry sand) and well aerated, and the soluble inorganic nitrogen in the ground water (up to 30 μg-at. N/l) was dominated by nitrate form (up to 22 μg NO3-N/l). By contrast, Llanddona sand had a more variable organic carbon content (0.22-2.25 mg C/g dry sand), was wetter, and poorly aerated with consequent sulphide lenses; its dissolved inorganic nitrogen (over 70 μg-at. N/l) was completely dominated by the ammonium form. Microbiologically, the beaches possessed dissimilar bacterial floras, and sediment from Llanddona gave higher bacterial counts than that from Newborough. For both beaches it is shown that estimated bacterial numbers decreased with depth as well as down the intertidal zone. {\copyright}1974.},

We have combined incubation using cyanoditolyl tetrazolium chloride (CTC) to detect respiratory activity with a modified fluorescent-antibody (FA) technique, for the enumeration of specific viable bacteria. Bacteria in suspensions were captured by filtration on nonfluorescent polycarbonate membranes that were then incubated on absorbent pads saturated with CTC medium. A specific antibody conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate was reacted with the cells on the membrane filter. The membrane filters were mounted for examination by epifluorescence microscopy with optical filters designed to permit concurrent visualization of fluorescent red-orange CTC-formazan crystals in respiring cells which were also stained with the specific FA. Experiments with Escherichia coli O157:H7 indicated that both respiratory activity and specific FA staining could be detected in logarithmic- or stationary-phase cultures, as well as in cells suspended in M9 medium or reverse-osmosis water. Following incubation without added nutrients in M9 medium or unsterile reverseosmosis water, the E. coli O157:H7 populations increased, although lower proportions of the organisms reduced CTC. Numbers of CTC-positive, FA-positive cells compared with R2A agar plate counts gave a strong linear regression (R 5 0.997). Differences in injury did not appear to affect CTC reduction. The procedure, which can be completed within 3 to 4 h, has also been performed successfully with Salmonella typhimurium and Klebsiella pneumoniae.},

	annote = {In the qualitative evaluation of naturally occurring waters used for bathing purposes bacteriological considerations play a decisive part, but owing to the environmental burden in the past and present, the chemical criteria of evaluation have gained increasing importance. The present trend here is compared with laws, ordinances and guidelines for other types of water quality, especially with respect to swimming pools, and reviewed regarding future decrees for swimming waters. For such recreational waters, i.e. running and still inland waters as well as sea water there are the Recommendations of the Federal Health Board of 1966 and an EEC Guideline of 1975. Tables indicate in detail the parameters which are of importance and what information the various parameters can furnish. Some requirements are inalienable and largely recognised internationally. For others, guide or limit values have not yet been established unequivocally. The establishment of limit values for recreational waters has proved rather difficult because evaluation is based on only few facts and much more on unspecific possibilities of infection. But three main criteria seem to gain ground for future consideration. 1. Visible general pollution. 2. Organic burden while making due allowance for persistent substances. 3. Inorganic burden with heavy metals as well as indicators for eutrophy and faecal contamination. For these main criteria, detailed and practice-related data are necessary which can be combined to aid bacteriology in pointing to a health risk from a certain water quality. Great store is set by the number of samples taken, the sampling points and the sampling depth and such terms as 'bathing areas' as well as 'bathing season' must be defined. Large bodies of water can be assessed with representative results only. Individual samples are not conclusive and the results derived from them sometimes lead to unfounded statements. The author condemns on principle a chemical analysis without the expert's personal co-operation right on the spot. Whereas e.g. drinking water, industrial water and als swimming-pool water allow a consistent water quality to be checked in the laboratory, bathing waters are exposed to a variety of natural conditions and anthropogenic measures, characterised by frequent changes and all this exercises a decisive influence on the water quality, the chemical parameters as well as their measurement and evaluation. At present, the chemical approach allows important criteria of quality, guide values, and limit values to be established for recreational waters.},

	annote = {This paper presents a framework for analyzing the economic, health, and recreation implications of swim closures related to high fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) levels. The framework utilizes benefit transfer policy analysis to provide a practical procedure for estimating the effectiveness of recreational water quality policies. Evaluation criteria include the rates of intended and unintended management outcomes, whether the chosen protocols generate closures with positive net economic benefits to swimmers, and the number of predicted illnesses the policy is able to prevent. We demonstrate the framework through a case study of a Lake Michigan freshwater beach using existing water quality and visitor data from 1998 to 2001. We find that a typical closure causes a net economic loss among would-be swimmers totaling {\$}1274-37,030/day, depending on the value assumptions used. Unnecessary closures, caused by high indicator variability and a 24-h time delay between when samples are taken and the management decision can be made, occurred on 14 (12{\%}) out of 118 monitored summer days. Days with high FIB levels when the swim area is open are also common but do relatively little economic harm in comparison. Also, even if the closure policy could be implemented daily and perfectly without error, only about 42{\%} of predicted illnesses would be avoided. These conclusions were sensitive to the relative values and risk preferences that swimmers have for recreation access and avoiding health effects, suggesting a need for further study of the impacts of recreational water quality policies on individuals.},

Initial counts, before starvation, were the same in all media tested. Following this period, P. aeruginosa became sensitive to PAB with added cetrimide. The addition of FeSO sub(4) did not improve the recovery of stressed P. aeruginosa but gave colonies a typical dark brown colour being easily differentiated from other species that can grow at 42 degree C. The modified Pseudomonas agar medium was also tested with several P. aeruginosa strains, other species of Pseudomonas, and other genera. Only P. aeruginosa strains (pyocyanin positive) produced the typical colonies. Our results demonstrate that Pseudomonas agar with ferrous sulphate, used for the differentiation of P. aeruginosa colonies, and nalidixic acid, used as an inhibitor of Gram-positive bacteria, might be a useful medium for the detection of injured P. aeruginosa in mineral water.},

It is significant that bacterial densities were several folds high (mean 168.2×103 nos.ml-100) in samples obtained from shallow open wells (15m. Bacterial counts, however, diminished markedly at increasing distances (>500m) from the sewage plant, the pollution index one km away being a mere 0.6.

On the basis of multivariate analysis (e.g. clustering and ordination through PRIMER) it was possible to divide the (17) locations into three categories as heavily contaminated, moderately contaminated and uncontaminated sites according to the loads of total faecal coliforms and streptococci.

Data from field tests on Lake Michigan bathing beach water samples showed that unverified 7-h FC counts averaged 96{\%} of the 24-h FC counts. The 7-h FC test was found to be suitable for the examination of surface waters and unchlorinated sewage and could serve as an emergency test for detection of sewage or fecal contamination of potable water.},

Microbial measures of sewage contamination prove to be extremely unreliable. The links between microbial indicators and water quality and between water quality and demonstrable health effects are variable at best. The outcomes of epidemiological studies agree in general terms-exposed populations exhibit more symptoms-but rarely agree in specifics, such as threshold levels for particular indicator organisms. The drive to improve Europe's bathing beaches initiated by the European Union in its bathing water directive has been a tremendous force for change. However, the investment of huge sums of money based on compliance with flawed microbiological standards is entirely inappropriate. Instead a holistic approach based on the assessment of all factors likely to promote risk to recreators is proposed. Such a beach registration scheme would remove the necessity to comply with fundamentally flawed and meaningless numerical standards.},

The Mediterranean destinations were chosen on the basis of their popularity with British visitors, the U.K. beaches on a fairly random basis. All the beaches in all countries were EU designated bathing waters, several holding the prestigious European Blue Flag award. Summary findings indicate that the five beaches sampled in Spain were all of very good microbiological quality for the ten days of sampling. Four of the beaches examined in Crete were of similar good quality. The fifth, at Malia, was of much poorer quality. The five Italian beaches all failed at least one of the Mandatory standards for either total or thermotolerant (faecal) coliforms. All these failures occurred on the same two days, coincident with heavy rainfall. The six U.K. beaches surveyed all passed Mandatory standards for total coliforms but one beach did not comply with the Mandatory standard for thermotolerant coliforms. The fact that several of the Mediterranean and U.K. beaches examined in the study were European Blue Flag beaches and that, on occasion, their water quality failed to meet the criteria for that award, suggests that such award schemes should clearly indicate that the guarantee of bather safety is far from absolute.

These types were present even in sewage from areas with no abattoirs; human beings were thus shown to be the main source of antibiotic resistant types in the rivers. Smith2 subsequently determined the incidence of antibiotic resistant coliforms and R+ E. coli in coastal bathing waters and reported that the ratio of the concentrations of the different kinds of antibiotic resistant coliform organisms to each other and to the antibiotic sensitive organisms in the seawater resembled that in human sewage previously examined1. He concluded2 that R+ E. coli in seawater provided "stronger evidence of contamination with human sewage", and that "the present undesirable situation could be corrected immediately if proper disposal of sewage from seaside towns were practised". {\copyright}1972 Nature Publishing Group.},

In the present study, C. jejuni NCTC 11168 was grown under mildly acidic conditions mimicking those encountered in the intestine. The resulting transcriptional profiles revealed how this bacterium fine-tunes gene expression in response to acid stress. This adaptation involves the differential expression of respiratory pathways, the induction of genes for phosphate transport, and the repression of energy generation and intermediary metabolism genes. We also generated and screened a transposon-based mutant library to identify genes required for wild-type levels of growth under mildly acidic conditions. This screen highlighted the important role played by cell surface components (flagella, the outer membrane, capsular polysaccharides, and lipooligosaccharides) in the acid stress response of C. jejuni. Our data also revealed that a limited correlation exists between genes required for growth under acidic conditions and genes differentially expressed in response to acid. To gain a comprehensive picture of the acid stress response of C. jejuni, we merged transcriptional profiles obtained from acid-adapted cells and cells subjected to acid shock. Genes encoding the transcriptional regulator PerR and putative oxidoreductase subunits Cj0414 and Cj0415 were among the few up-regulated under both acid stress conditions. As a Cj0415 mutant was acid sensitive, it is likely that these genes are crucial to the acid stress response of C. jejuni and consequently are important for host colonization.},

	annote = {Summary The impairment of water quality by faecal pollution is a global public health concern. Microbial source tracking methods help to identify faecal sources but the few recent quantitative microbial source tracking applications disregarded catchment hydrology and pollution dynamics. This quantitative microbial source tracking study, conducted in a large karstic spring catchment potentially influenced by humans and ruminant animals, was based on a tiered sampling approach: a 31-month water quality monitoring (Monitoring) covering seasonal hydrological dynamics and an investigation of flood events (Events) as periods of the strongest pollution. The detection of a ruminant-specific and a human-specific faecal Bacteroidetes marker by quantitative real-time PCR was complemented by standard microbiological and on-line hydrological parameters. Both quantitative microbial source tracking markers were detected in spring water during Monitoring and Events, with preponderance of the ruminant-specific marker. Applying multiparametric analysis of all data allowed linking the ruminant-specific marker to general faecal pollution indicators, especially during Events. Up to 80% of the variation of faecal indicator levels during Events could be explained by ruminant-specific marker levels proving the dominance of ruminant faecal sources in the catchment. Furthermore, soil was ruled out as a source of quantitative microbial source tracking markers. This study demonstrates the applicability of quantitative microbial source tracking methods and highlights the prerequisite of considering hydrological catchment dynamics in source tracking study design.},

Although members of the enterovirus group have been suggested as possible indicators of sewage pollution in marine waters, the lack of rapid, sensitive and cost effective methods have prevented routine monitoring in the United States. This study compared traditional cell culture and direct RT-PCR (reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction) amplification for detection of an enterovirus. Poliovirus could be recovered from 100 L of artificial seawater with an average efficiency of 77{\%}, using adsorption and elution from electronegative filters. Viruses were eluted from the filters with 1.5{\%} beef extract for viruses (BEV) adjusted to pH 9.5 and reconcentrated by organic flocculation to a volume of 30 mL. Substances which interfered with detection by RT-PCR were removed by treatment of the concentrates with sephadex and chelex resins. Direct RT-PCR could detect 2.5 and 0.025 PFU (plaque forming units) for single (25 cycles) and double PCR (2 X 25 cycles) in 10 μL of pure culture poliovirus samples, respectively. These methods are currently being applied to assess the occurrence of enteroviruses at marine bathing beaches influenced by sewage discharges.},

No statistical correlation existed between the counts of indicator bacteria, Cl. perfringens, E. coli, and enterococci and occurrence of Cryptosporidium or Giardia. In sludge end-products, Giardia cysts were detected more frequently than Cryptosporidium oocysts.

	annote = {Lagooning is a simple natural process, flexible and efficient which in the Mediterranean climate is well suited for the purification of domestic wastewater. It is also applicable for the sewage from small rural communities because of its low cost and the simple technology required to ensure its successful use. Because of the big seasonal population variations in the coastal areas of the Mediterranean that may occur, it is advantageous to make use of lagoon treatment since the process is capable of accepting impurity loads that vary considerably. The process also has the advantage of eliminating a very large proportion of the organic load as well as destroying a considerable part of the bacterial population of the sewage. It is therefore suitable for the treatment of sewage arising near bathing beaches or shell fish areas. In Languedoc, during the past 15 years use of this process, experimental work has been in progress and over a period of 5 years precise formulae have been arrived at for calculating the parameters for the design of lagoons suitable for Mediterranean conditions. These include the following: The depth of water should be 1.2m in the first lagoon and 1m in subsequent lagoons. The normal maximum loading is 75 kg BOD per hectare per day, with a short period peak of 100-120 kg BOD per day during midsummer. The detention period with 0.08 - 1.20 m depth is 30-50 days. One hectare of lagoon is adequate for the treatment of sewage from 1500 - 2000 inhabitants, in winter without previous settlement of the sewage. In summer the population might increase to 2500 - 3000. One hectare is adequate for the removal of bacteria from the sewage of 2000 persons in winter and 3000 in summer.},

	annote = {This study aimed to investigate the impact of small tributaries on seawater and shellfish quality in coastal area subjected to brief episodes leading to fecal contamination. Escherichia coli and F-RNA-specific bacteriophages were selected as fecal indicators and astroviruses were chosen as being representative of pathogens in the human population during winter viral epidemics. A two-dimensional hydrodynamic model was built to simulate the current and dispersion in the model domain, which includes areas uncovered at low tide. The model also includes decay rates to simulate microorganism behavior and assess the influence of fecal input on shellfish quality. The originality lies in the fact that specific features of the study area were considered. Modeling results indicate limited particle movements and long flushing times at the back of the bay, where shellfish are farmed. Computational results showed that under normal conditions, i.e. 94{\%} of the time, when rainfall was less than 10 mm per day, the sector shows acceptable water quality. These results are in agreement with shellfish concentration measured in the field. Under high flow conditions, high concentrations of fecal indicators and astrovirus were measured in the river and tributaries. The corresponding fluxes were over 50 times higher than under normal weather conditions. The location of the shellfish beds near the coast makes them vulnerable and fecal indicators and viruses were detected in shellfish after short rainfall events. Our modeling approach makes a contribution to shellfish management and consumer protection, by indicating the "risk period" as defined by EU regulations. Molecular development such as viral quantification in conjunction with model developments will help to prevent shellfish contamination and thus provide safer products to consumers and an effective tool for shellfish producers. {\copyright}2007 Elsevier Ltd.

	annote = {Two major factors determine the spatial and temporal distributions of fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) at a given beach: local circulation \& mixing patterns, and bacterial inactivation rates. High frequency and spatial resolution bacterial sampling combined with measurements of physical processes can be used to infer inactivation rates, enabling differentiation between dilution \& mortality as factors driving variability in nearshore FIB abundance. A FIB sampling experiment (HB06) took place on 16 October 2006, at Huntington State Beach, a site selected due to its persistent problems with FIB pollution. Water samples were taken at 20-minute intervals (from 6:50am to 11:50am) at ten locations; four in an alongshore transect spanning 1 km at the shoreline, and the remainder in a 300-m long cross-shore transect. All samples were analyzed for FIB concentration (Total Coliforms, E. coli \& Enterococci) and, for a subset, species level Enterococcus composition was determined. As part of the HB06 experiment, currents, temperature, waves, and chlorophyll fluorescence were measured simultaneously in the cross-shore direction with rapid CTD casts 300 m offshore. Results indicate that E. coli and Enterococcus concentrations exhibit exponential decreases with time, with smaller decay rates associated with depth and with sites in the Talbert Marsh and Santa Ana River. FIB concentrations are also noticeably lower farther offshore (300 m). Spatio-temporal patterns in FIB concentration will be presented in conjunction with the nearshore physical data allowing the relationship between physical dynamics and biological variability to be addressed.},

An array of water quality parameters were also measured simultaneous with bacteria sampling. Both species of vibrio were associated with estuary and mangrove locations, and neither was isolated from sandy beaches. Densities of V. vulnificus were negatively correlated with high salinities, 10-15 ppt being optimal. Vibrio parahaemolyticus was isolated from sites with salinities between 20 and 35 ppt, the highest densities occurring at 20 ppt. Densities of Vibrio spp and V. parahaemolyticus for a tropical estuary surpassed those reported for temperate estuaries by several orders of magnitude. Both densities of total Vibrio spp and V. parahaemolyticus in the water were directly related to densities of fecal coliforms, unlike V. vulnificus. The incidence of ONPG(+) strains among sucrose(-) Vibrio spp served as an indicator of the frequency of V. vulnificus in this group. More than 63{\%} of the V. vulnificus isolated were pathogenic. Vibrio vulnificus and V. parahaemolyticus occupy clearly separate niches within the tropical estuarine-marine ecosystem. {\copyright}1989.},

The hypothesis states that during the summer when the water column is most stratified the wastewater plume was being transported toward shore whereupon it then interacted with a local electrical power generation station's intake and/or thermal discharge plume to cause the observed chronic shoreline microbiological contamination. In response to this hypothesis, the District implemented an intensive, multi-faceted, multi-agency research study during the spring to fall 2001 to study both high and low frequency cross-shelf oceanographic transport processes on the San Pedro Shelf that could bring the plume toward shore.},

However, the bacterial indicators currently used for monitoring water quality do not correlate with the presence of pathogens. Here we demonstrate that the plant pathogen Pepper mild mottle virus (PMMoV) is widespread and abundant in wastewater from the United States, suggesting the utility of this virus as an indicator of human fecal pollution. Quantitative PCR was used to determine the abundance of PMMoV in raw sewage, treated wastewater, seawater exposed to wastewater, and fecal samples and/or intestinal homogenates from a wide variety of animals. PMMoV was present in all wastewater samples at concentrations greater than 1 million copies per milliliter of raw sewage. Despite the ubiquity of PMMoV in human feces, this virus was not detected in the majority of animal fecal samples tested, with the exception of chicken and seagull samples. PMMoV was detected in four out of six seawater samples collected near point sources of secondary treated wastewater off southeastern Florida, where it co-occurred with several other pathogens and indicators of fecal pollution. Since PMMoV was not found in nonpolluted seawater samples and could be detected in surface seawater for approximately 1 week after its initial introduction, the presence of PMMoV in the marine environment reflects a recent contamination event. Together, these data demonstrate that PMMoV is a promising new indicator of fecal pollution in coastal environments.},

A total of 17 sites (9 lagoon canal and 8 beach sites) were assayed. For the canals of the Venice Lagoon, 78{\%} were positive for both HAV and enteroviruses, with levels ranging from 75 to 730 and 3 to 1614 genome copies/L, respectively. At Lido beach, HAV was never detected, but enteroviruses were detected in all Lido beach samples at levels ranging from 2 to 71 genome copies/L. There was a statistically significant correlation between thermotolerant coliform densities and HAV levels (p=0.0002), but the relationship between thermotolerant coliform densities and enterovirus levels was not significant (p>0.05). Despite the fact that enteroviruses were detected at low levels in the surfzone at Lido beach, the risk for enteroviral infection (calculated using the beta-Poisson model) for recreational exposure from swimming, was in the range of 1.9×10-3-6.1×10-2, yielding a disease risk at or below the level (5{\%} for gastroenteritis) deemed acceptable by European Guide standards. {\copyright}2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Areas where coliform bacteria exceeded standards were more prevalent north of the Santa Ana River, whereas enterococci exceedances covered a broad area both north and south of the river. Higher concentrations of bacteria were associated with spring tides. No temporal correspondence was found between these bacterial events and either the timing of cold water pulses near shore due to internal tides, or the presence of southerly swell in the surface wave field. All three fecal indicator bacteria exhibited a diel cycle, but enterococci rebounded to high nighttime values almost as soon as the sun went down, whereas coliform levels were highest near the nighttime low tide, which was also the lower low tide. {\copyright}2006 Elsevier Ltd.

	title = {Water Quality at Wildlife Water Sources in the Sonoran Desert, United States},
	annote = {Surface water is an important limiting factor for wildlife populations in desert environments where water sources are uncommon or have been lost or degraded due to human activities. To address this need, wildlife water developments have been constructed in many areas of the southwestern United States, particularly in the Sonoran Desert. Previous studies of wildlife water developments are limited and critics have asserted that water quality at these facilities may be deleterious to animal health. Water quality was evaluated at natural, modified natural, and constructed water sources in the Sonoran Desert of southwestern Arizona and southeastern California. Samples were taken from primary sources of surface water available to wildlife, including natural tinajas (rock basins), modified tinajas, springs, rainwater catchments ('guzzlers'), and wells. Water samples were tested for 21 chemical constituents known to affect animal health, blue-green algal toxins, and a presumed waterborne pathogen, the protozoan avian parasite Trichomonas gallinae. Seven chemical constituents were absent or below detection limits. The majority of constituents detected (10/13, 77{\%}) occurred at levels below recommended guidelines for domestic animals. Elevated pH, alkalinity, and fluoride were found in rainwater catchments, springs, and wells, respectively, but at relatively low levels unlikely to affect animal health. Blue-green algal toxins were not detected and there was no evidence of Trichomonas. Although specific water quality guidelines for wildlife are lacking, these results do not support hypothesized negative impacts to wildlife populations from developed water sources.Original Abstract: El agua superficial es un factor limitante importante para las poblaciones de fauna silvestre de los ambientes deserticos, donde las fuentes de agua son poco comunes o se han perdido o degradado debido a las actividades humanas. Para resolver esta necesidad se han construido aguajes para la fauna silvestre en muchas areas del suroeste de Estados Unidos de America, particularmente en el Desierto Sonorense. Estudios previos acerca de este tema son limitados y los criticos han declarado que la calidad del agua en estos aguajes pude ser perjudicial para la salud animal. La calidad del agua se evaluo en aguajes naturales, naturales modificados y construidos por el hombre en el Desierto Sonorense en el suroeste de Arizona y sudeste de California. Las muestras fueron tomadas de fuentes primarias de agua superficial disponibles para la fauna silvestre, incluyendo tinajas naturales (cunecas de roca), tinajas modificadas, manantiales, capturas de agua de lluvia ('guzzlers') y pozos. En las muestras de agua se evaluaron: 21 constituyentes quimicos que se sabe afectan la salud animal, toxinas de algas azul-verde y un patogeno, que se presume es acarreado por el agua, el protozoario parasito de las aves Trichomonas gallinae. Siete de los constituyentes estuvieron ausentes o abajo de los limites de deteccion. La mayoria de los constituyentes detectados (10/13, 77{\%}) estuvieron en niveles abajo de los recomendados para animales domesticos. En un tipo de fuente de agua se encontro pH elevado, alcalinidad y fluorfuro, pero en niveles relativamente bajos que es improbable que afecten la salud animal. No se detectaron toxinas de algas azul-verde ni evidencia de Trichomonas. En tanto se crezca de lineamientos especificos de la calidad del agua para la fauna silvestre, estos resultados no sostienen las hipotesis de los impactos negativos para las poblaciones de fauna silvestre por efecto de los aguajes construidos para ellas. El diseno de aguajes y las practicas de mantenimiento son recomendadas para mejorar la calidad del agua.},

Introduction of enterococci as a new quality parameter may pose a challenge in some areas because relatively less is known about these organisms compared to E. coli. In the present study, the relative abundance of intestinal enterococci, E. coli, and ten fecal sterol and stanol biomarkers were investigated in water and sediment at two estuarine beach sites affected by fecal pollution. In the bathing water, enterococci were relatively more abundant at low E. coli concentrations. In the sediment, enterococci were generally more abundant than E. coli with surface concentrations between 1.0×102 and 4.5×103 CFU cm-3. Enterococci populations were relatively similar in water and sediment, and were phenotypically different from that of nearby pollution sources. The putative human specific genetic marker esp in Enterococcus faecium was not detected in water or sediment samples despite occasional inputs of human waste from storm water overflows. Sterol and stanol profiles suggested a direct link between water and sediment pollution profiles on days with wind conditions that facilitated resuspension. Sediment resuspension may occur at wind speeds exceeding 6-8 m s-1, and could contribute significantly to enterococci concentrations in the overlying water. The study emphasized that recontamination of the water column due to wind induced resuspension should be considered when evaluating indicator levels and microbial hazards in estuarine recreational waters. {\copyright}2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

	annote = {A number of bacterial, viral and other diseases can be contracted by man through exposure to sewage-polluted bathing-water or beach sand. The increasing use of the sea for recreation has led to major concern regarding health hazards to both local and tourist populations. Epidemiological studies attempting to correlate microbiological water quality with health effects have produced different results, leading to a wide variation in recreational water quality criteria and standards applied, and to considerable controversy regarding their implementation. The Mediterranean provides a good example of a problem region where health risks are accentuated as a result of high utilization of bathing areas coupled with long exposure periods. Coastal pollution by sewage is still a major concern and control measures vary considerably. A number of microbiological/epidemiological studies have been carried out since 1953 in an attempt to define the levels of risk following exposure to different concentrations of bacteria in bathing waters. Most of these have been prospective studies whose design involved subject recruitment on the beach itself, classification of swimmers on the basis of immersion of the head in the water, and follow-up interviews after 7-10 days, together with a system for validation of gastrointestinal symptomatology. Practically all studies showed higher morbidity among bathers as compared to non-bathers, but correlation between specific symptoms and bacterial indicator concentrations varied considerably. On the basis of the 1972-1978 Cabelli Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) study in the United States of America, later developed by EPA into a recommended health-effects criterion for marine recreational waters, one would expect 25-40 gastrointestinal cases per 1,000 persons exposed to seawater containing 100 enterococci per 100 ml. Extrapolation of these figures to annual bathing populations indicates the potential magnitude of the problem. Much more work is needed however before a satisfactory dose-response relationship is obtained, principally because of confounding factors inherent in all studies carried out so far, which still require a solution.},

Elevation estimates, acquired with NASA's Airborne Topographic Mapper (ATM), were compared to elevations measured with three types of ground-based measurements - 1) differential GPS equipped all-terrain vehicle (ATV) that surveyed a 3-km reach of beach from the shoreline to the dune, 2) GPS antenna mounted on a stadia rod used to intensely survey a different 100 m reach of beach, and 3) a second GPS-equipped ATV that surveyed a 70-km-long transect along the coast. Over 40,000 individual intercomparisons between ATM and ground surveys were calculated. RMS vertical differences associated with the ATM when compared to ground measurements ranged from 13 to 19 cm. Considering all of the intercomparisons together, RMS ≃15 cm. This RMS error represents a total error for individual elevation estimates including uncertainties associated with random and mean errors. The latter was the largest source of error and was attributed to drift in differential GPS. The ≃15 cm vertical accuracy of the ATM is adequate to resolve beach-change signals typical of the impact of storms. For example, ATM surveys of Assateague Island (spanning the border of MD and VA) prior to and immediately following a severe northeaster showed vertical beach changes in places greater than 2 m, much greater than expected errors associated with the ATM. A major asset of airborne lidar is the high spatial data density. Measurements of elevation are acquired every few m2 over regional scales of hundreds of kilometers. Hence, many scales of beach morphology and change can be resolved, from beach cusps tens of meters in wavelength to entire coastal cells comprising tens to hundreds of kilometers of coast. Topographic lidars similar to the ATM are becoming increasingly available from commercial vendors and should, in the future, be widely used in beach surveying.},

	annote = {Sediments of five Ligurian beaches in compliance with European Union bathing water regulations were studied based on the characteristics of the fungal assemblage during the tourism season. Among the 179 taxa of filamentous fungi isolated, 120 were opportunistic pathogens, such as Acremonium sp., and the genus Penicillium was also present as the pathogenic species P. citrinum. Furthermore, 5{\%} of the total filamentous fungi belonged to the dermatophyte genus Microsporum, whose species can cause mycoses. Beach sediments showed elevated densities of opportunistic pathogens, of pathogenic filamentous fungi, and of yeasts during the tourism season. Although monitoring of beach sediments for microbiological contamination is not mandatory, and disease transmission from sediments has not yet been demonstrated, our study suggests that beach sediments may act as a reservoir of potential pathogens, including fungi. In addition, the mycoflora displayed high sensitivity to critical environmental situations in the beaches studied. Therefore, the fungal community can be a useful tool for assessing the quality of sandy beaches in terms of sanitary and environmental quality. {\copyright}2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Water samples were collected at these 15 beaches less than 24-h after a rainfall event of at least 6 mm. The effect of rainfall on bacterial concentrations along the Wisconsin shores of Lake Superior was investigated. Water samples were collected at a water depth of 24-30 inches as specified by the requirements of the WI BEACH Program. The Colisure{\textregistered}test was utilized for Escherichia coli (E. coli) and coliform determinations. No relationship between rainfall amount and bacterial concentrations at any of the 15 beaches tested was found. Although other researchers have observed a direct positive relationship between rainfall and E. coli levels in beach water, we found no significant relationship for Lake Superior beaches. This is an important finding given the fact that beach closures are often based upon rainfall alone, rather than on actual E. coli concentration measurements. This study reinforces the fact that the data obtained at one location should not necessarily be extrapolated to beach closure decisions at other locations. {\copyright}Springer Science + Business Media, Inc. 2006.},

The volume and duration of these overflow points and, consequently, the capacity of the coastal interceptor-collectors, are conditioned by the environmental regulations governing receptor waters, and more specifically, in most cases, by those governing bathing waters. The most widely accepted criteria on the quality of these waters are those established by the corresponding directive in terms of exceedance time of fecal coliform concentration limits {$[$}nonfulfillment time (NFT){$]$}. This random variable is itself conditioned by a series of factors, and can be studied by means of complex models with high computing costs.

	title = {Modeling the dry-weather tidal cycling of fecal indicator bacteria in surface waters of an intertidal wetland},
	annote = {Recreational water quality at beaches in California and elsewhere is often poor near the outlets of rivers, estuaries, and lagoons. This condition has prompted interest in the role of wetlands in modulating surface water concentrations of fecal indicator bacteria (FIB), the basis of water quality standards internationally. A model was developed and applied to predict the dry- weather tidal cycling of FIB in Talbert Marsh, an estuarine, intertidal wetland in Huntington Beach, California, in response to loads from urban runoff, bird feces, and resuspended sediments. The model predicts the advection, dispersion and die-off of total coliform, Escherichia coli, and enterococci using a depth-integrated formulation. We find that urban runoff and resuspension of contaminated wetland sediments are responsible for surface water concentrations of FIB in the wetland. Model predictions show that urban runoff controls surface water concentrations at inland sites and sediment resuspension controls surface water concentrations near the mouth. Direct wash-off of bird feces into the surface water is not a significant contributor, although bird feces can contribute to the sediment bacteria load. The key parameters needed to accurately predict FIB concentrations, using a validated hydrodynamic model, are: the load due to urban runoff, sediment erodibility parameters, and sediment concentrations and surface water die-off rates of enteric bacteria. In the present study, literature values for sediment erodibility and water column die- off rates are used and average concentrations of FIB are predicted within 1/2 log unit of measurements. Total coliform are predicted more accurately than E. coli or enterococci, both in terms of magnitude and tidal variability. Since wetland-dependent animals are natural sources of FIB, and FIB survive for long periods of time and may multiply in wetland sediments, these results highlight limitations of FIB as indicators of human fecal pollution in and near wetlands.},

	annote = {The City of Myrtle Beach, South Carolina has evolved over the past three (3) decades as one of the most popular beach resorts on the East Coast of the United States with more than 14 million visitors annually. Stormwater management for the City has consisted of some seventy-nine (79) outfall pipes leading to the beach, coupled with natural swashes which collect stormwater from inland areas. The beach outfalls are unsightly and cause erosion of the natural beach. In addition, the stormwater transmits bacteria to the beach during and immediately after a rainfall event. In spite of these problems the City had taken no action to find alternatives to eliminate these pipes due to the significant expense and because no citizen or visitor had ever become ill due to contact with the stormwater from these pipes. The City was forced to reexamine their position in 1997. The Clean Water Act of 1972 effectively strengthened existing laws and regulations to prevent, reduce or control water pollution. This paper will present the thought process, political issues, regulatory/environmental obstacles and the results of this large scale stormwater management replacement and revitalization Project.

	annote = {Advances in microbial source tracking (MST) have largely been driven by the need to comply with water quality standards based on traditional indicator bacteria. Recently, a number of culture-independent, and library-independent methods based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) have been gaining popularity among source trackers. However, only a limited number of these methods have been successfully used in field applications, primarily due to the fact that many of them are still being developed. In this critical outlook, we examine different viewpoints associated with the practical use of MST to identify critical research gaps, propose a priority-based timeline to address them, and outline emerging technologies that will likely impact the future of source tracking. We propose that it is necessary to consider each of these aspects in order to advance towards a unifying framework in source identification, so that fecal pollution monitoring can be reliably used for comprehensive environmental microbial monitoring, to develop risk assessment models, and to implement and validate adequate management practices.},

Their applicability to wave-driven, open coast environments has not been tested. We assessed the contribution of a tidal outlet to surf zone water quality in coastal Orange County, California, USA by measuring three traditional culture-based fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) as well as the human-specific Bacteroides molecular marker (HF marker) at four shoreline locations. We found that total and fecal coliform levels were higher during low tides than high tides at two of the four stations, and that this effect was strongest at the mouth of the tidal lagoon and decayed with distance from the outlet. The HF marker was detected in 23{\%} and 47{\%} of samples from the tidal outlet and 26{\%} and 41{\%} of samples from an adjacent recreational beach in 2005 and 2006 respectively. Surprisingly, the station farthest from the tidal outlet had the highest occurrence of the HF marker. We found no relationship between FIB abundance and occurrence of the HF marker for individual samples, but that when the data were considered together by year, higher FIB abundance was correlated with a higher incidence of the HF marker. DNA sequences of the HF marker recovered from this site were > 99{\%} similar to those recovered from other states and countries, suggesting low global diversity of this marker. These data provide strong support for the idea that multiple time points and physical conditions should be considered when assessing coastal water quality. {\copyright}2007 The Authors.},

The system conducts bacterial lysis, nucleic acid isolation and concentration, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and end-point fluorescent detection. To enable truly low-cost manufacture of the single-use disposable chip, we designed the plastic chip in a planar format without any active components to be amenable to injection molding and utilized a novel porous polymer monolith (PPM) embedded with silica that has been shown to lyse bacteria and isolate the nucleic acids from clinical samples (M. D. Kulinski, M. Mahalanabis, S. Gillers, J. Y. Zhang, S. Singh and C. M. Klapperich, Biomed. Microdevices, 2009, 11, 671--678).1 The chip is made of Zeonex{\textregistered}, a thermoplastic with a high melting temperature to allow PCR, good UV transmissibility for UV-curing of the PPM, and low auto-fluorescence for fluorescence detection of the amplicon. We have built a prototype instrument to automate control of the fluids, temperature cycling, and optical detection with the capability of accommodating various chip designs. To enable fluid control without including valves or pumps on the chip, we utilized a remote valve switching technique. To allow fluid flow rate changes on the valveless chip, we incorporated speed changing fluid reservoirs. The PCR thermal cycling was achieved with a ceramic heater and air cooling, while end-point fluorescence detection was accomplished with an optical spectrometer; all integrated in the instrument. The chip seamlessly and automatically is mated to the instrument through an interface block that presses against the chip. The interface block aligns and ensures good contact of the chip to the temperature controlled region and the optics. The integrated functionality of the chip was demonstrated using Bacillus subtilis as a model bacterial target. A Taqman assay was employed on-chip to detect the isolated bacterial DNA.},

	annote = {Occurrence and prevalence of different bacterial enteric pathogens as well as their relationships with conventional (total and fecal coliforms) and alternative fecal indicators (host-specific Bacteroides 16S rRNA genetic markers) were investigated for various water samples taken from different sites with different degrees of fecal contamination. The results showed that a wide range of bacterial pathogens could be detected in both municipal wastewater treatment plant samples and in surface water samples. Logistic regression analysis revealed that total and human-specific Bacteroides 16S rRNA genetic markers showed significant predictive values for the presence of Escheriachia coli O-157, Salmonella, heat-labile enterotoxin (LT) of enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC), and heat-stable enterotoxin for human (STh) of ETEC. The probability of occurrence of these pathogenic bacteria became significantly high when the concentrations of human-specific and total Bacteroides 16S rRNA genetic markers exceeded 103 and 104 copies/100 mL. In contrast, Clostridium perfringens was detected at high frequency regardless of sampling sites and levels of Bacteroides 16S rRNA genetic markers. No genes related to Shigella spp., Staphylococcus aureus and Vibrio cholerae were detected in any samples analyzed in this study. Conventional indicator microorganisms had low levels of correlation with the presence of pathogens as compared with the alternative fecal indicators. These results suggested that real-time PCR-based measurement of alternative Bacteroides 16S rRNA genetic markers was a rapid and sensitive tool to identify host-specific fecal pollution and probably associated bacterial pathogens. However, since one fecal indicator might not represent the relative abundance of all pathogenic bacteria, viruses and protozoa, combined application of alternative indicators with conventional ones could provide more comprehensive pictures of fecal contamination, its source and association with pathogenic microorganisms.},

We studied the survival and transport of a model enterovirus (BE-1) and faecal coliform bacteria in four on-site wastewater treatment systems (three conventional and one low pressure, small pipe diameter, pumped system) located in sandy soils typical of the coastal plains. Septic system wastewaters were seeded seasonally with known amounts of BE-1 and the fate of BE-1, faecal coliforms and other wastewater constituents were followed for three months in seeded wastewaters and groundwaters of drainfield monitoring wells. BE-1 levels in seeded wastewaters declined exponentially by kinetics consistent with a 3d hydraulic residence time. BE-1 was detected in ground waters of monitoring wells as early as 1d after seeding and persisted up to two months. Virus detection in ground water was greater in winter than in summer and was positively associated with proximity to septic effluent distribution lines, drainfield soils with the lowest clay content, elevated ground water pH and shallower vadose zones. Viruses were not strongly associated with either distance from septic tank or faecal coliform levels in groundwater, Under optimum conditions, virus reductions were as high as 9 log10, but in systems with the most coarse (sand) soils and highest water tables (most shallow vadose zones), there was extensive ground water contamination by viruses and other wastewater constituents. Under some conditions, septic systems in sandy coastal plains soils can contaminate ground water with viruses and other wastewater constituents.

Comprehensive computer models of sewage plume behaviour were developed.

There has been a significant decrease in contamination of biota by trace metals and organochlorine compounds in nearshore areas, but no measurable increase in contaminants in organisms in offshore waters. Although no consistent pattern was observable, changes in offshore fish and invertebrate communities have occurred, manifested as increases and decreases in abundance.

The most common pathogens found are Campylobacter and Listeria. Salmonella has never been isolated. The presence of pathogens is usually accompanied by the presence of classic indicators of contamination such as Escherichia coli, enterococci and other aerobic bacteria. Exceptions are only to be observed in cases of samples presenting very low numbers of pathogens. Such low pathogen levels have a minimal impact on human health; but we cannot exclude that, during periods affected by specific conditions, higher levels might temporarily occur. Our research has demonstrated that classic indicators can be considered as efficient detectors of pathogens in most cases. When these indicators are used systematically and regularly, the human health hazard can be qualified as low but not negligible. The presence of pathogens, together with their survival capacity, brings the protection measures currently applied to safeguard drinking waters sharply into question.},

To assess whether water quality problems are concentrated at a small number of chronically affected sites or whether the problems are widely distributed, we compiled 5 years of monitoring data collected at 59 sites, 22 of which are sampled daily. Other locally available rainfall and sewage spill monitoring information data were added to this data set to assess whether sewage spills, dry-weather runoff, or wet-weather runoff contribute the most to exceedences of water quality thresholds. Approximately 13{\%} of the shoreline mile-days along monitored beaches in SMB exceeded the State of California's beach water quality standards during the 5-year study period. Most of the water quality exceedences occurred near urban runoff drains even though areas affected by drains represent only a small portion of the total shoreline. Although storms are relatively infrequent in southern California, the extent of water quality exceedences resulting from storm water runoff was similar to the extent of water quality exceedences found during dry weather. Sewage spills, while potentially more serious because they lead to beach closures rather than to the more limited posting of warning signs, represented less than 0.1{\%} of the shoreline mile-days that exceeded water quality thresholds. During dry weather conditions, most of the water quality problems occurred near five of the largest drains and at two beach areas that have unique physical characteristics, which limited mixing, dispersion, and dilution. During wet weather conditions, water quality problems were more widespread. {\copyright}2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The location of each sampling site was determined using global positioning system (GPS), and estimates of geographic coverage were determined using geographic information system (GIS) techniques. Twenty-one programs conducted 87,007 tests annually at 576 sites in the study area. The largest number of sites was sampled in Orange County, whereas the largest number of analyses was performed in Los Angeles County because monitoring programs in this area focused on daily monitoring. Fifteen of the 21 programs were managed by National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permitted sewage effluent dischargers who sampled both offshore and shoreline waters and typically tested for three indicator bacteria (total coliform, fecal coliform, and enterococcus). Their combined efforts comprised 82{\%} of all of the microbiological indicator analyses conducted on an annual basis. Five of the remaining monitoring organizations were public health agencies, which typically focus their efforts on testing only total coliforms. Laboratory methodology also varied considerably, with NPDES permittees predominantly utilizing membrane filtration while public health agencies generally used multiple tube fermentation or premanufactured test kits. Nearly three quarters of all the effort expended in southern California occurred along the shoreline as opposed to offshore locations. Two thirds of this shoreline effort was focused on high-use sandy beaches and in proximity to perennial fresh-water outlets (storm drains and creeks). Most sampling occurred at a set of fixed sites that were revisited frequently, but only represented about 7{\%} of the total shoreline. We estimated that roughly {\$}3 million is spent annually on monitoring bathing water quality in southern California, exceeding that spent in any other part of the country.},

A comprehensive field data set was available including intensive offshore survey data collected during a two-week period; these were used as a time series for the verification of the hydrodynamic model. River discharges and water quality data were used as boundary and initial conditions for the model. The impact of alternative land-use management strategies on the water quality of the receiving estuarine and coastal waters was investigated by modelling a series of 14 scenarios. Generally, the model results show that the faecal indicator organism input from point sources of sewage effluent dominated during dry weather and base flow conditions. On the other hand, riverine sources (such as diffuse catchment sources) significantly dominated the concentrations in the bay both during and after rainfall events. Finally, it was found that a reduction in land used for animal husbandry can considerably reduce the critical peak concentration occurring after heavy rainfall events. hydraulics \& hydrodynamics/mathematical modelling/pollution.},

This report is one of the products of Phase I of the Corridor Study. A literature review of surface-water-quality, surface- water-quantity, and ecology studies conducted from 1970 through 2001 was completed and is summarized in this report. An inventory of Geographic Information System spa- tial coverages available for the MMSD planning area has been assembled. A database of water, sediment, and tissue (fish, shell- fish, and others) chemistry, macroinvertebrates, fish, algae, habitat, geomorphic, and other physical and ecological data was compiled from data sets from MMSD, U.S. Geological Survey, Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources, and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. More than 2.7 million results are available in the MMSD Corridor Study database and the compilation of multiple datasets allows for retrieving data from a central database rather than from each of the source datasets. Data for 1970 through 2002 were col- lected for the 420-square-mile planning area by various agencies using different field data-collection and laboratory- analysis methods. Chemical constituents and ecological components that are important to an urban setting and well represented in the database were selected for further investi- gation. Each constituent or component is described in this report with some or all of the following: a text summary, map of sampling locations, and in some cases median con- centrations, statistical distributions of concentrations by sub- watershed, table of summary statistics by subwatershed, and graphs of temporal and (or) seasonal trends. Physical data presented in the report include stream- flow, stream stage, and precipitation data. Chemical indica- tors of water quality presented in the report include field measurements and miscellaneous constituents (pH, alkalin- ity, specific conductance, hardness, dissolved oxygen, bio- chemical oxygen demand, and chloride), sediment (total sus- pended solids and suspended sediment), nutrients (total nitrogen, nitrate, Kjeldahl nitrogen, total phosphorus, and dissolved phosphorus), trace elements (cadmium, mercury, copper, lead, arsenic, chromium, nickel, and zinc), pesticides (historically used pesticides and pesticides still in use), and polychlorinated biphenyls. Ecological indicators of water quality discussed in the report include community surveys of macroinvertebrates and fish, chlorophyll a concentrations, habitat assessments and channel-measurement data, and fecal coliform and E. coli bacterial counts. In addition to the compilation of the database, a major purpose of this investigation was to identify additional sam- pling that should be conducted under the baseline monitoring phase, which will be the second phase of the Corridor Study. Additional sampling may include: Some subwatersheds, such as those in the headwaters. · Emerging contaminants such as pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs), human hormones, organic wastewater contaminants, and other constituents that result from human activity. · E. coli, which can serve as an indicator of health risk to swimmers and other recreationl water users. · Pesticides in all media. · PCBs. · Trace elements in water, bed sediment, and tissues (fish, shellfish, and others). · Samples during winter months or during early snowmelt episodes to address constituents such as chloride and some nutrients that have seasQnal vari- ability and that may be affected by factors such as road deicing during the winter. · Samples for macroinvertebrate and fish-community data and habitat assessments. · Physical data such as stream-channel cross-section profiles, bridge-scour assessments, flood-plain maps, structures, and shoreline conditions. },

During phase 1 (year one), physio-chemical, biological and morphological measurements were taken within 16 sub-watersheds, ranging in size from 500-2500 ha. Nutrient and fecal coliform concentrations within watersheds with impervious surface > 5{\%} often exceeded those in other watersheds during both baseflow and storm flow. Also, fecal coliform bacteria in more urbanized areas often exceeded the US EPA's standard for recreational waters.

Enteroviruses are regularly detected in environmental waters or shellfish and can provoke potentially serious diseases. Some authors believe that enteroviruses could represent an interesting indicator of viral contamination in the environment. Since molecular approaches seem to be promising for the detection of these viruses, we developed a simple qualitative RT-PCR procedure for enteroviruses, together with a quantitative RT-PCR assay using RNA internal standard. After one-tube-RT-PCR, this standard and wild enterovirus RNA were detected by differential hybridization with specific probes and a fluorimetric reaction. The quantification of enteroviruses, conducted in a sewage treatment plant, showed a decreasing number of genomic copies from the entrance to the exit (from 3.8×105 to 5.4×104 RNA copies/mL) but indicated the presence of enterovirus RNA in the neighboring river (2.2×103 RNA copies/mL). In bathing areas, enterovirus RNA was detected in 16 out of 226 samples, with copies numbers ranging from 3.7×102 RNA copies/mL to 7×104 RNA copies/mL. {\copyright}2001 {\'E}ditions scientifiques et m{\'e}dicales Elsevier SAS.},

In many instances, these waterways are contaminated with fecal pollution that can contribute to recreational water illness. Unfortunately, monitoring recreational waters for disease-causing microorganisms is not as straightforward as it would seem. In addition to the well-known pathogenic bacteria such as Escherichia coli, Salmonella, and Shigella, protozoa including Cryptosporidium and Giardia and viruses, in particular noroviruses and adenoviruses, are also major contributors to recreational water illness. Protozoa and viruses persist in the environment for much longer periods of time than do bacteria, and virus transport through surface and subsurface water is both faster and farther than that of bacteria. The great diversity in pathogenic microorganisms that can be transmitted by water and the difficulty in developing and implementing detection strategies for all possible microbes has resulted in the selection of a few indicator organisms to determine the presence and magnitude in a waterway of microorganisms causing recreational water illness. These classic indicators include total coliforms, fecal coliforms, E. coli, and enterococci, many of which have been used as indicators for over 100 years.},

Two beach sites separated by 150 m of shoreline on Lake Michigan were monitored in the summer of 2003 and 2004 for E. coli densities to evaluate the potential outcome of relocating an existing beach to a site immediately to the south. Under identical weather conditions, there was a large disparity between the two sites for 25 of the 39 days tested, where E. coli levels at the existing beach were at least twice as high as those at the proposed beach. Following rainfall, E. coli levels at the existing beach increased up to 100-fold to levels as high as 4,500 CFU/100 mL, whereas only a 10-fold increase in levels was observed at the proposed beach site. Water exchange in the beach areas was predominantly from wind driven currents rather than dilution, and longshore current speed at the proposed beach was calculated to be twice that of the existing beach. Stormwater and combined sewer overflow (CSO) discharged from two closely spaced outfalls approximately 0.5 km north of the existing beach was found to have E. coli levels above the EPA recommended limit of 235 CFU/100 mL for recreational waters. However, this input did not appear to be a major influence on beach monitoring results. In some cases, E. coli levels at the beach did not exceed 235 E. coli/100 mL during a CSO. Defining the sources and spatial range of pollution inputs would allow beach monitoring results to be interpreted in a more meaningful context, which may lead to the formation of effective management strategies.},

	m = {Journal Article},
	annote = {Fecal pollution of water systems can exact high risks to human health and can result in significant economic losses due to closures of beaches and shellfish harvesting areas. The ability to effectively track the sources of pollution within a watershed is imperative for proper risk assessment and remedial efforts to be evaluated and enacted. Several microbiological, genotypic, phenotypic, and chemical methods have been proposed as useful tools for tracking the sources of fecal pollution. Here, we describe the effective use of the ribotyping microbial source tracking procedure to determine the source(s) of Escherichia coli within a South Carolina watershed. In this study, 92{\%} of animal-derived E. coli isolates collected were correctly classified as being of animal origin using our existing ribotype profile database. These results suggest that the temporal and spatial diversity of E. coli may not be a significant factor in broad source (human versus animal) classification of E. coli by using our ribotyping DNA fingerprinting procedure. In addition, direct matching of ribotype profiles from water samples to those from known animal sources was used as an index of the potential predominant sources of fecal input(s) into this watershed. This method was useful in assessing possible specific animal sources when statistical analysis of a ribotype profile indicated general animal fecal pollution. Prior to investigating potential fecal inputs into this watershed, a significant human source was suspected as the primary input; however, of the 515 E. coli isolated from water samples collected during the course of this study, 88{\%} were typed as being of animal fecal origin. Thus, this study was integral in the realization that animals may be a significant source of contamination and that remediation efforts should be redirected to accommodate these findings. This study summarizes one of the few case studies in which ribotyping was successfully utilized to further resolve a "true-life" water quality and management problem.},

The 30 day maximum geometric mean of 200 fecal coliforms per 100 ml of water recommended as the acceptable maximum limit in the 1983 Guidelines for Canadian Recreational Water for bather protection was achieved by beaches in all three geographic regions. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) criterion of 126 Escherichia coli per 100 ml of water was satisfied by the beaches on the west side of Lake Winnipeg. The USEPA criterion of 33 enterococci per 100 ml, as well as the enterococcus criteria proposed for Manitoba were not met by most beaches in all three regions. Before recommending changes to the national guidelines for recreational water quality (i.e. adding enterococci criteria), it is important to document an association between illness and counts of a specific indicator bacteria, standardize the test procedures for this bacteria, and to agree on the bacterial counts that would relate to an acceptable risk to bathers.

Microorganism concentrations from high-density residential areas were higher than those associated with low-density residential and landscaped commercial areas. Since the outfalls were free of sanitary wastewater cross-connections, the major sources of microorganisms to the stormwater runoff were most likely from the feces of domestic animals and wildlife. Concentrations of microorganisms were significantly affected by the season during which the samples were collected. The lowest concentrations were observed during winter except for Staphylococcus aureus. The Pearson correlation coefficients among different indicators showed weak linear relationships and the relationships were statistically significant. However, the relationships between indicators and pathogens were poorly correlated and were not statistically significant, suggesting the use of indicators as evidence of the presence of pathogens is not appropriate. Further, the correlation between the concentration of the traditionally monitored indicators (total coliforms and fecal coliforms) and the suggested substitutes (enterococci and E. coli) is weak, but statistically significant, suggesting that historical time series will be only a qualitative indicator of impaired waters under the revised criteria for recreational water quality by the US EPA.},

Coliphage density was significantly related (P = <0,05) to cloud cover, groundswell and flotsam. Correlations between microbiological indicators proved high (0.62 ≤r ≤0.90, P = <0.001). The percentage of Salmonella presented significant (<0.05), albeit low (r < 0.4), correlations with all microbiological parameters. Somatic coliphages also revealed highly significant (0.32 ≤r ≤0.66) correlations (P = <0.001). Those obtained for F-RNA phages, in contrast, were low (r ≤0.33). The equations obtained using a multiple regression analysis with a view to predicting microbiological, viral, and Salmonella indicator density demonstrated that environmental variables facilitate the construction of highly significant equations, but that these have low predictive capability (R2 = <0.50). {\copyright}1998 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd on behalf of the IAWQ.

Eutrophic levels of chlorophyll and phosphorus were present in all seasons. Harmful cyanobacterial blooms were prevalent during the summer months. Microcystin toxin and fecal coliform bacteria levels were measured that exceeded health and safety standards. Low concentrations of herbicides (atrazine and 2,4-D) were also detected during summer months. Drainage from the stormwater pond may transport contaminants into the adjacent tidal creek and estuary. A survey of residents within the pond's watershed indicated poor pet waste management and frequent use of fertilizers and pesticides as possible contamination sources. Educational and outreach activities were provided to community members to create an awareness of the water quality conditions in the pond. Pond management strategies were then recommended, and selected mitigation actions were implemented. Water quality problems identified in this study have been observed in other coastal stormwater ponds of varying size and salinity, leading this project to serve as a potential model for coastal stormwater pond management. {\copyright}2007 Elsevier Ltd.

	annote = {Soil structure depends on the association between mineral soil particles (sand, silt, and clay) and organic matter, in which aggregates of different size and stability are formed. Although the chemistry of organic materials, total microbial biomass, and different enzyme activities in different soil particle size fractions have been well studied, little information is available on the structure of microbial populations in microhabitats. In this study, topsoil samples of different fertilizer treatments of a long-term field experiment were analyzed. Size fractions of 200 to 63 mm (fine sand fraction), 63 to 2 mm (silt fraction), and 2 to 0.1 mm (clay fraction) were obtained by a combination of low-energy sonication, wet sieving, and repeated centrifugation. Terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis and cloning and sequencing of 16S rRNA genes were used to compare bacterial community structures in different particle size fractions. The microbial community structure was significantly affected by particle size, yielding higher diversity of microbes in small size fractions than in coarse size fractions. The higher biomass previously found in silt and clay fractions could be attributed to higher diversity rather than to better colonization of particular species. Low nutrient availability, protozoan grazing, and competition with fungal organisms may have been responsible for reduced diversities in larger size fractions. Furthermore, larger particle sizes were dominated by a-Proteobacteria, whereas high abundance and diversity of bacteria belonging to the Holophaga/Acidobacterium division were found in smaller size fractions. Although very contrasting organic amendments (green manure, animal manure, sewage sludge, and peat) were examined, our results demonstrated that the bacterial community structure was affected to a greater extent by the particle size fraction than by the kind of fertilizer applied. Therefore, our results demonstrate specific microbe-particle associations that are affected to only a small extent by external factors.},

Water samples from all these sites were collected between October 2004 and June 2006 at a regular monthly interval and within 48 h of rain events. The samples were analyzed for bacterial counts including faecal coliform and total coliform; faecal sterols including coprostanol, epicoprostanol, cholesterol, cholestanol, 24-ethylcoprostanol, campesterol, stigmasterol and β-sitosterol; and the elements including Na, Rb, Sr, Ag, Cd, Sn, Cs, Ba, Hg, Tl, Pb, Bi, U, Mg, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, K, As, Se, P and Mo. Over the course of the sampling period, the STP site had the highest average coprostanol level of 1693$\pm$567 ng/L which was significantly higher (p<0.05) than the septic sites (190$\pm$71 ng/L), the cattle sites (163$\pm$94 ng/L) and forested sites (14$\pm$4 ng/L). As expected, the forested sites had significantly lower average level of faecal coliforms (373$\pm$87 cfu/100 mL) compared with the STP (1395$\pm$574 cfu/100 mL), septic (1243$\pm$494 cfu/100 mL) and cattle sites (535$\pm$112 cfu/100 mL). The concentrations of coprostanol were not correlated with the numbers of faecal coliform bacteria when the entire data set was evaluated. The forested sites generally had the lowest average levels of elemental compositions, with significantly lower levels noted for Na, U, Mg, V, Cu, Sr, K, As, P and Mo, whereas Fe was the only element notably higher in the forested sites. Temporal and rain events analyses of the data set revealed that elevated levels of both coprostanol and faecal coliforms were not exclusive to rain events. The average coprostanol levels in rain event samples at each site were not significantly different compared with the corresponding dry event samples. Conversely, faecal coliform numbers increased by 2--4 times in rain events samples from septic, cattle and forested sites, but did not alter in the STP site. Multivariate analyses identified coprostanol and Sr as major contributing factors for the discrimination of septic, cattle, STP and forested sites for both rain and dry events samples. It was clear that each land use type of catchment could be characterized by biochemical, bacteriological and elemental parameters.},

Fecal coliform and Fecal Streptococci as indicators and Salmonella the pathogenic bacteria were examined in the water and sand samples collected from Benid Al-Qar Sea beach. Water samples and sand samples were collected for a span of 8 months. Sampling of sand was done at distances of 5 m and 10 m on both left and right sides away from the opening of emergency outfall. Shell samples were also collected to ascertain the presence of any contaminant. The analytical data showed that occasional discharge of wastewater resulted in the accumulation of 710 colonies for F. coliform, 20 colonies for F. Streptococci and 125-colonies/100 ml for Salmonella in sand samples collected from 5 m distance on the left side of an emergency outfall. On moving to 10 m distance the intensity of accumulation was reduced about 50{\%} i.e. 360 colonies, 10 colonies and 75 colonies/100 ml for F. coliform, F. Streptococci and Salmonella respectively. The intensity of accumulation was further reduced in the sand samples collected from the right side of the emergency outfall opening. Gradually all these accumulated types of bacterial cells showed inactivation due to solar radiation exposure and other oceanographic factors. Within a month no growth of any indicator or pathogenic microbe was noticed in the sand samples. Again the F. coliform bacteria started appearing in the sand samples collected during 7 months of the project due to discharge of untreated wastewater under the emergency situation, i.e. renovation of sewage networks. Again the same trend of inactivation of bacterial cells was noticed. Thus Kuwait Sea beaches are not threatened of marine pollution due to occasional discharge of wastewater.},

Because many coastal wetlands are adjacent to urban centers and waters used for human recreation, it is important to understand how wildlife can affect water quality. We measured fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) concentrations, presence/absence of Salmonella, bird abundance, and physico-chemical parameters in two coastal, managed ponds and adjacent sloughs for 4 weeks during the summer and winter in 2006. We characterized the microbial water quality in these waters relative to state water-quality standards and examined the relationship between FIB, bird abundance, and physico-chemical parameters. A box model approach was utilized to determine the net source or sink of FIB in the ponds during the study periods. FIB concentrations often exceeded state standards, particularly in the summer, and microbial water quality in the sloughs was generally lower than in ponds during both seasons. Specifically, the inflow of water from the sloughs to the ponds during the summer, more so than waterfowl use, appeared to increase the FIB concentrations in the ponds. The box model results suggested that the ponds served as net wetland sources and sinks for FIB, and high bird abundances in the winter likely contributed to net winter source terms for two of the three FIB in both ponds. Eight serovars of the human pathogen Salmonella were isolated from slough and pond waters, although the source of the pathogen to these wetlands was not identified. Thus, it appeared that factors other than bird abundance were most important in modulating FIB concentrations in these ponds.},

IM beads prepared in-house with four commercial anti-O157 monoclonal antibodies were compared for efficiency of cell capture. IM-ECL responses for E. coli O157:H7 (strain SEA13B88) were similar for all four commercial anti-O157 LPS monoclonal antibodies. The ECL signal was linearly correlated with E. coli O157:H7 cell concentration, indicating a constant ECL response per cell. Twenty-two strains of E. coli O157:H7 or O157:NM gave comparable ECL signals using IM beads prepared in-house. To assess the potential for interference from background bacteria in MLB-enriched water samples, 104 cells of E. coli O157:H7 (strain SEA13B88) were added to enriched samples prior to analysis. There was considerable variability in recovery of E. coli O157:H7 cells; net ECL signals ranged from 1{\%} to 100{\%} of expected values (i.e., percent inhibition from 0{\%} to 99{\%}). Cultures of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, and Enterobacter cloacae, subsequently isolated from MLB-enriched water samples via IM separation (IMS), were observed to interfere with the binding of E. coli O157:H7 cells to IM beads. Recoveries of 104 E. coli O157:H7 cells were </=10{\%} in the presence of ca. 108 K. pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, or E. cloacae cells. None of these strains gave a positive IM-ECL signal. Although competitive binding decreased sensitivity, there still was a linear correlation between ECL signal and higher E. coli O157:H7 cell concentrations. These studies indicate that IM-ECL in conjunction with MLB enrichment is capable of quantitatively detecting as few as 103 to 105 E. coli O157:H7 cells ml-1, depending on percent recoveries, in enriched samples that contain ca. 109 total lactose-fermenting bacteria ml-1. Assuming comparable growth rates for E. coli O157:H7 and other lactose-fermenting bacteria in MLB, it may be possible to detect as few as one E. coli O157:H7 in 100 ml of raw water containing as many as 104 to 106 lactose-fermenting bacteria (i.e., total coliforms).},

In this paper we report the results of a dual tracer study on a 40 km reach of the Grand River, the longest river in Michigan, and we examine the performance of bacteriophage P22 relative to a chemical tracer (Rhodamine WT).

Estimated P22 inactivation rates were found to be in the range 0.27-0.57 per day (0.12-0.25 log10 per day). The highest inactivation rate was found in a reach with high suspended solids concentration, relatively low dissolved organic carbon content, and sediment with high clay content. Estimated TS model parameters for both tracers were found to be consistent with surficial geology and land use patterns. Maximum storage zone sizes for the two tracers were found in different river reaches, indicating that different processes contributed to TS within the same reach for the two tracers. This model can be used to examine the arrival times and concentrations of human viral pathogens released from untreated sewage at recreational areas.},

	annote = {Five models for predicting rates of aeolian sand transport were evaluated using empirical data obtained from field experiments conducted in April, 1994 at a beach on Inch Spit, Co. Kerry, Republic of Ireland. Measurements were made of vertical wind profiles (to derive shear velocity estimates), beach slope, and rates of sand transport. Sediment samples were taken to assess characteristics of grain size and surface moisture content. Estimates of threshold shear velocity were derived using grain size data. After parsing the field data on the basis of the quality of shear velocity estimation and the occurrence of blowing sand, 51 data sets describing rates of sand transport and environmental conditions were retained. Mean grain diameter was 0.17 mm. Surface slopes ranged from 0.02 on the foreshore to about 0.11 near the dune toe. Mean shear velocities ranged from 0.23 m s-1 (just above the observed transport threshold) to 0.63 m s-1. Rates of transport ranged from 0.02 kg m-1 h-1 to more than 80 kg m-1. h-1 . These data were used as input to the models of Bagnold {$[$}Bagnold, R.A., 1936. The Movement of Desert Sand. Proc. R. Soc. London, A157, 594-620{$]$}, Kawamura {$[$}Kawamura, R., 1951. Study of Sand Movement by Wind. Translated (1965) as University of California Hydraulics Engineering Laboratory Report HEL 2-8, Berkeley{$]$}, Zingg {$[$}Zingg, A.W., 1953.

Experimental and Micrometeorological Field Studies of Dune Migration. In: K. Lettau and H. Lettau (Eds.), Exploring the World's Driest Climate. University of Wisconsin-Madison, IES Report 101, pp. 110-147{$]$}. Correction factors to adjust predictions of the rate of transport to account for the effects of slope and moisture content were calculated using the models of Bagnold {$[$}Bagnold, R.A., 1973. The nature of saltation and 'bed-load' transport in water. Proc. R. Soc. London, Ser. A, 332, 473-504{$]$} and Belly {$[$}Belly, P.-Y., 1964. Sand movement by wind. U.S. Army Corps Eng. CERC. Tech. Mem. 1, Washington D.C., 38 pp.{$]$}, respectively. None of the models was able to produce a strong correspondence between measured and predicted rates of transport. Best results were obtained using the Bagnold and Zingg models, and the Kadib model was the least viable of this group. The influence of sediment moisture content appeared to be the critical factor in degrading model viability. Overall, none of the models is adequate for general applications to coastal-aeolian environments where moisture content complications tend to override the predictive competence of the simple transport formulations. {\copyright}1998 Elsevier Science B.V.},

On the high bather load day, an increase occurred in the numbers of fecal coliforms and fecal streptococci in the beach water in conjunction with an increase in the bather load; P. aeruginosa levels increased later in the day. There was little apparent relationship between C. albicans levels and the other parameters on the high bather load day. No corresponding increases were observed for any of the monitored parameters on the low bather load days. The results indicate that bather load and sample collection time may influence estimations of recreational water quality based on fecal pollution indicator and P. aeruginosa levels.

The beaches surveyed could be differentiated on the basis of bacterial fecal pollution indicator levels and numbers of the pathogens C. albicans and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The occurrence of C. albicans and P. aeruginosa appeared to be related to elevated fecal pollution indictor levels.

Like Cryptosporidium, infection has been associated with a variety of sequelae such as Guillain-Barre syndrome, reactive arthritis syndrome (formally Reiter syndrome) and acalculous cholecystitis. There has been much debate as to where to place C. cayetanensis taxonomically due to its homology with Eimeria species. To date, the only genomic DNA sequences available are the ribosomal DNA of C. cayetanensis and three other species; within these a high degree of homology has been observed.

Rapidly occurring changes in coastal land uses and the influence on water quality increases the urgency of having improved decision tools. For this study, samples were collected monthly from six coastal ponds, two tidal creeks and four shallow water wells for up to 2 frac(1, 2) years. These data were used along with other measures of environmental conditions and land classes within each watershed to construct quantitative relationships between combinations of variables and both total and presumed wildlife sources of FCB. Linear regression, bootstrapping and generalized additive modeling that incorporates both linear and nonlinear terms were used. Results of repeated simultaneous sampling on the same tide stage of ponds and downstream estuarine creeks suggest that most FCB come from wildlife and that the ponds effectively remove these bacteria except immediately following heavy rainfall. Predictive models for concentrations of total and presumed wildlife bacteria are provided along with simple measures to estimate watershed boundaries. It is proposed that these tools can be used to minimize impacts on receiving water body quality. The models can be used to test alternative development approaches within coastal watersheds similar to that found in the southeastern USA coastal zone as well as to evaluate specific proposed landscape alterations. {\copyright}2006 Elsevier Ltd.

	annote = {Experiments were carried out to assess the fortnightly effects of mixed semi-diurnal tides and tidally-induced aquifer over-height on the timing, magnitude, and quality of submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) from an unconfined beach aquifer impacted by septic tank effluent at Stinson Beach, California. Groundwater- and ocean elevations, salinity, and nutrient concentrations were monitored throughout a 14-day neap/spring cycle. A freshening of the surf zone coupled with an increase in nutrient concentrations was observed at neap tide and attributed to discharge of fresh, nutrient-rich groundwater during that part of the fortnight. Nutrient concentrations in the surf zone returned to near-offshore levels during the spring tide. Estimates of SGD were made with chemically- and physically-based methods. Fresh SGD was maximal during the neap tide although total SGD was maximal during the spring tide. An overheight of time-averaged piezometric head was observed in the aquifer near the beach face throughout the 14-day experiment. This over-height varied significantly with tidal range, thereby controlling the seaward hydraulic gradient across the fresh part of the aquifer and, thus, the flow of nutrient-rich fresh groundwater to the coastal ocean. We discuss the role of aquifer overheight in controlling submarine discharge of fresh groundwater and related non-point source pollution from unconfined aquifers in similar environments.},

The objective of this study was to determine the ability of denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) to differentiate mixed assemblages of E. coli in the natural environment. After confirming the identity of 184 environmental bacterial isolates as E. coli, each was subjected to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of the β-glucuronidase gene (uidA) followed by DGGE fingerprinting. The ability of DGGE to discriminate individual isolates at the strain level was determined by comparing fingerprints to those resulting from a standard, library-dependent fingerprinting method, BOX-PCR. Computerized analysis of fingerprints indicated that DGGE and BOX-PCR identified 15 and 21 unique phylotypes respectively. Rank-abundance plots comparing the numerical distribution of unique E. coli phylotypes detected by both methods revealed no difference in resolution at the population level. In water and sediment samples from two beaches, DGGE effectively distinguished indigenous E. coli populations with an average rate of correct classification (site-based) of 83{\%}. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis of uidA genes isolated and PCR-amplified from environmental samples appears to be an effective tool to differentiate unique E. coli populations and should be useful to characterize E. coli dynamics in the secondary environment. {\copyright}2006 The Authors.},

A spiking protocol using the non-fecal bacterium Pseudomonas syringae pph6 was developed to estimate the recovery of DNA from fecal and environmental samples. The measured fecal marker concentrations were used to calculate baseline ratios and variability of host-specific to generic indicators for each host type. The host-specific markers were found in high concentrations (8--9 log10 copies/g dry wt.) in their respective hosts' samples, which were equal to or greater than the concentrations of generic E. coli and Enterococcus markers, lending support to the use of host-specific and generic Bacteroidales as sensitive indicators of fecal pollution. The host-specific markers formed a consistent percentage of total Bacteroidales in target host feces and raw sewage, with human-specific comprising 82{\%}, dog-specific 6{\%}, cow-specific 4{\%} and horse-specific 2{\%}. Based on this limited data set, the measurement of host-specific indicators by qPCR has several promising applications. These applications include determining the percentage of total Bacteroidales contributed by a specific host type, using the ratios of host-specific markers to E. coli or Enterococcus to estimate the contribution of each source to these regulated fecal indicator bacteria, and estimating the mass of feces from each host type in environmental samples.},

It was investigated through case finding, a case-control study, sampling potential sources of infection and by molecular typing (using sequence-based typing (SBT) of all Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1 (Lp1) isolates). Lp1 was isolated from the respiratory tract of one case, the roof-collected rainwater systems of five households (three associated with cases) and from a water blaster at a nearby marina. All isolates were indistinguishable, exhibiting the same SBT allele pattern. Three LD cases lived within 500 m of the water blaster (the fourth case within 1250 m) and downwind in prevailing conditions. Another domestic roof-collected rainwater supply contaminated by Lp1 (identical SBT pattern) was incidentally identified in another suburb 4 km east of Beachlands. This is the first outbreak of LD linked to roof-collected rainwater supplies and the first isolation of Legionella from these systems in New Zealand. Aerosols containing Legionella discharged to air by the marina water blaster may have infected some cases directly or may have seeded roof-collected rainwater systems. Some cases may have been exposed by contaminated bathroom showers. Roof-collected rainwater systems need appropriate design, careful cleaning and the maintenance of hot water temperatures at a minimum of 60 $\,^{\circ}$C to reduce the chances of Legionella multiplying. Further research into the ecology of Legionella in roof-collected rain water systems is indicated. {\copyright}2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

While waterways can be impaired in numerous ways, the protection from pathogenic microbe contamination is most important for waters used for human recreation, drinking water and aquaculture. Typically, monitoring methods used for detecting potential pathogenic microorganisms in environmental waters are based upon cultivation and enumeration of fecal indicator bacteria (i.e. fecal coliforms, E. coli, and fecal enterococci). Currently, there is increasing interest in the potential for molecular fingerprinting methods to be used not only for detection but also for identification of fecal contamination sources. Molecular methods have been applied to study the microbial ecology of environmental systems for years and are now being applied to help improve our waters by identifying problem sources and determining the effect of implemented remedial solutions. Management and remediation of water pollution would be more cost-effective if the correct sources could be identified. This review provides an outline of the main methods that either have been used or have been suggested for use in microbial source tracking and some of the limitations associated with those methods.},

Ten experiments were conducted outdoors in 300-liter chambers, held at 14$\,^{\circ}$C (mean river water temperature). Sunlight inactivation (kS) rates, as a function of cumulative global solar radiation (insolation), were all more than 10 times higher than the corresponding dark inactivation (kD) rates in enclosed (control) chambers. The overall kS ranking (from greatest to least inactivation) was as follows: enterococci > fecal coliforms > E. coli > somatic coliphages > F-RNA phages. In winter, fecal coliform and enterococci inactivation rates were similar but, in summer, enterococci were inactivated far more rapidly. In four experiments that included freshwater-raw sewage mixtures, enterococci survived longer than fecal coliforms (a pattern opposite to that observed with the WSP effluent), but there was little difference in phage inactivation between effluents. In two experiments which included simulated estuarine water and seawater, sunlight inactivation of all of the indicators increased with increasing salinity. Inactivation rates in freshwater, as seen under different optical filters, decreased with the increase in the spectral cutoff (50% light transmission) wavelength. The enterococci and F-RNA phages were inactivated by a wide range of wavelengths, suggesting photooxidative damage. Inactivation of fecal coliforms and somatic coliphages was mainly by shorter (UV-B) wavelengths, a result consistent with photobiological damage. Fecal coliform repair mechanisms appear to be activated in WSPs, and the surviving cells exhibit greater sunlight resistance in natural waters than those from raw sewage. In contrast, enterococci appear to suffer photooxidative damage in WSPs, rendering them susceptible to further photooxidative damage after discharge. This suggests that they are unsuitable as indicators of WSP effluent discharges to natural waters. Although somatic coliphages are more sunlight resistant than the other indicators in seawater, F-RNA phages are the most resistant in freshwater, where they may thus better represent enteric virus survival.},

This is especially true in areas such as Southern California and the Mediterranean which have experienced tremendous population growth. This study examined marine sediment cores collected from various depths of water and distances from the White's Point's sewage outfall to determine the presence and vertical distribution of selected microorganisms of public health significance. A logarithmic decrease of the indicator bacteria populations with increasing depth in the sediment was observed. Random isolations of Aeromonas occurred but none of the enteric pathogens or viruses included in this study were detected. The classic indicator bacteria were of little value in predicting the presence of enteric pathogens. Clostridium perfringens populations may be a suitable indicator for the presence of sewage sludge in marine sediments and provide a historical record of the deposition and movement of sewage particulates but Clostridium perfringens populations were not related to the presence of pathogens in sediments. Results suggest that the persistence of pathogens in marine sediments are related to abiotic factors and may vary geographically.},

	annote = {Numerous sources of infectious disease causing microorganisms exist in watersheds and can impact recreational and drinking water quality. Organisms of concern include bacteria, viruses, and parasites. The watershed manager is challenged to limit human contact with pathogens, limit the numbers of pathogens reaching surface or groundwaters, and limit the pathogens reaching crops eaten raw to levels below those needed to cause infection. Therefore, the goal of the National Risk Management Research Laboratory's (NRMR) watershed pathogens research program is to develop optimum solutions for managing the complex problem of watershed microbial contamination and thus support watershed managers' decision making. It supports the Agency's Strategy for Waterborne Microbial Disease Control by addressing contamination sources, named in the strategy as one of the highestpriority approaches to waterprotection. Thispaper summarizes the current state of the knowledge on the sources and impacts of microbialpathogens in the watershed and discusses challenges to their successful management, research underway to resolve them, and research that is planned by the NRMRL.},

Thirty stations were sampled using a probabilistic sampling design. Hydrographic data were collected in addition to samples for water chemistry. Bacterial indicators, enterococci and fecal coliforms, were enumerated from the water according to the EPA Beaches Environmental Assessment Closure and Health (BEACH) Program and Florida state guidelines. Additional criteria for site condition included the presence or absence of primary and secondary dunes, anthropogenic debris and vegetation. Based on EMAP evaluation guidelines and Florida state criteria, a baseline assessment of the condition of the Gulf of Mexico beach resources surveyed is presented. {\copyright}Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2006.},

In cattle the incidence of S Typhimurium DT104 also peaked in 1996, with 138 incidents, and it has similarly decreased every year to 2001 when there were 10 reported incidents. Similar declines have been observed in its incidence in sheep and pigs. In people the number of reports of S Enteritidis PT4 peaked in 1997 at 1684 and then declined to 457 in 2001. In chickens, the number of reports of S Enteritidis PT4 peaked in 1998 at 34 incidents, but no incidents were reported in the following three years.},

Because acceptable levels are an expression of the desired state of the ecosystem, the process of establishing acceptable levels should incorporate not just ecological understanding but also societal values. The goal of this research was to explore an approach for defining acceptable levels of ecological indicators that explicitly considers social perspectives and values. We used a set of eight indicators that were related to issues of concern in the Lake Champlain Basin. Our approach was based on normative theory. Using a stakeholder survey, we measured respondent normative evaluations of varying levels of our indicators. Aggregated social norm curves were used to determine the level at which indicator values shifted from acceptable to unacceptable conditions. For seven of the eight indicators, clear preferences were interpretable from these norm curves. For example, closures of public beaches because of bacterial contamination and days of intense algae bloom went from acceptable to unacceptable at 7--10 days in a summer season. Survey respondents also indicated that the number of fish caught from Lake Champlain that could be safely consumed each month was unacceptably low and the number of streams draining into the lake that were impaired by storm water was unacceptably high. If indicators that translate ecological conditions into social consequences are carefully selected, we believe the normative approach has considerable merit for defining acceptable levels of valued ecological system components.},

Detection of these enteroviruses is costly and time consuming. Small, single-stranded RNA phages that infect E. coli are likely to be present in all feces-contaminated environmental sources in substantial numbers and are easily detected and differentiated. These coliphages appear to offer some potential as indicators or indices of the presence of enteroviruses. Coliphages are likely to persist in groundwater due to the lack of nutrients, dilution of the bacterial hosts, and cool temperatures. Numerous techniques are available for working with coliphage, although they have been rarely applied to groundwater. Coliphages are both specific and versatile, providing opportunity for experimental manipulation to investigate particular aspects of groundwater pollution. It is possible to discriminate between phage types without great difficulty, based on their host specificity, morphological appearance of their plaques, and serological reactions. Much information exists concerning classification, distribution patterns and the ecological specifics of habitats of different phage types. For these reasons, a coliphage system for accurate prediction of the presence of human enteric viruses in groundwater could be developed.},

	annote = {Polyacrylamide (PAM) use in irrigation for erosion control has increased water infiltration and reduced soil erosion. This has improved runoff water quality via lower concentrations of nitrogen, phosphorous, and pesticides, and decreased biological oxygen demand. Since non-toxic high molecular weight anionic PAMs removed clay size sediment particles in flowing water, we hypothesized that PAM would effectively remove or immobilize microorganisms in flowing water. In an agricultural field, we determined the efficacy of PAM-treatment of furrow irrigation water to remove several categories of microorganisms in the inflow and runoff. Treatments were: (1) PAM application and a control; (2) three flow rates; (3) two distances from the in¯ow point; and (4) three times during each irrigation. After water traveled 1 m at 7.5 and 15.5 l min{\"y}1 , PAM-treatment reduced total bacterial and microbial biomass and total fungal biomass relative to the control treatment. After water traveled 40 m at 7.5, 15.5, and 22.5 l min-1 , PAM-treatment reduced algae, the numbers active and total bacteria, active and total fungal length, and total bacterial biomass, total fungal and microbial biomass relative to the control treatment. Although specific organisms were not identified or monitored in this study, the results clearly have implications for controlling the spread of soil-borne plant pathogens and other classes of harmful organisms within and among fields via irrigation water and in re-utilized return flows. Beyond furrow-irrigated agriculture, new methods to manage overland transmission of harmful microorganisms could potentially help control transport of pathogens from animal waste in runoff and groundwater.},

Tergitol agar, not recommended for recreational water analysis, may be useful for potable water evaluations due to its desirable recovery characteristics. Bromthymol blue produced detectable coloration of colonies grown in six hours of incubation, but low reliability of differentiation between coliform and non-coliform colonies was observed. Finally, a gas chromatographic analysis method was examined, based on the determination of ethanol from ethanol-producing coliform bacteria in water. The method was found to be applicable to the determination of ethanol-producing coliform bacterial concentrations ranging from 2-2000 organisms per 100 ml of water within 12 hours of culture incubation. While the methods studied are not sufficient to substitute for conventional coliform assays, further work and refinement of innovative approaches was encouraged in order that a more rapid determination of bacterial water quality might be attained.

	annote = {The filtration process of Sabella spallanzanii Gmelin on bacterial community was studied in a coastal area of the Northern Ionian Sea (Mediterranean Sea) at three sites, S. Vito, Lido Gandoli and Lido Silvana, where some specimens of S. spallanzanii were transplanted. Analyses were performed both on water and worm samples. A total of six microbial groups were examined: culturable heterotrophic bacteria, total culturable bacteria at 37$\,^{\circ}$C, culturable vibrios, total and fecal coliforms and fecal streptococci. The bacterial densities were usually orders of magnitude higher in the worm homogenates than in the corresponding seawater and the highest values were observed in August. The ability of S. spallanzanii to accumulate the microbial pollution indicators suggests this species can be employed as a bioindicator for monitoring water quality. Moreover, the accumulation capability of S. spallanzanii for specific micro-organisms provides a potential role in sewage bioremediation. {\copyright}2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	annote = {Fecal coliform (FC) contamination in coastal waters is an ongoing public health problem worldwide. Coastal wetlands and lagoons are typically expected to protect coastal waters by attenuating watershed pollutants including FC bacteria. However, new evidence suggests that coastal lagoons or marshes can also be a source of high indicator organism concentrations in coastal waters. We asked for a Mediterranean-type climate, what is the fate of runoff-associated FC through a coastal lagoon? To address this question, we developed a mass balance-based, mechanistic model of FC concentration through a coastal lagoon and simulated, for summer and winter conditions, FC within the lagoon water column, lagoon sediments, and in the ocean water just downstream of the lagoon mouth. Our model accounts for advective flow and dispersion, decay and sedimentation and resuspension of FC-laden sediments during high flow, erosional conditions. Under low flow conditions that occur in the summer, net FC decay and FC storage in lagoon sediments are predicted. Under high flow conditions that occur in the winter, FC-laden sediments are predicted to erode, resuspend and flow out of the lagoon where they elevate FC concentrations in the coastal ocean. For both seasonal conditions, the predicted water column FC concentrations were within an order of magnitude of field measurements for a reference site in southern California. Our results suggest that there are seasonally varying roles for coastal lagoons in mediating FC contamination to coastal waters. {\copyright}2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

We conducted a seroepidemiologic study with the following goals: 1) to determine the feasibility of using antibody markers as indicators of waterborne pathogen infection in the evaluation of water and sanitation intervention projects; 2) to characterize the epidemiology of waterborne diarrheal infections in rural Guatemala, and 3) to measure the age-specific prevalence of antibodies to waterborne pathogens. Between September and December 1999, all children 6-36 months of age in 10 study villages were invited to participate. We collected sufficient serum from 522 of 590 eligible children, and divided them into six-month age groups for analysis (6-12, 13-18, 19-24, 25-30, and 31-36 months). The prevalence of antibodies was lowest in children 6-12 months old compared with the four older age groups for the following pathogens: enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (48{\%}, 81{\%}, 80{\%}, 77{\%}, and 83{\%}), Norwalk virus (27{\%}, 61{\%}, 83{\%}, 94{\%}, and 94{\%}), and Cryptosporidium parvum (27{\%}, 53{\%}, 70{\%}, 67{\%}, and 73{\%}). The prevalence of total antibody to hepatitis A virus increased steadily in the three oldest age groups (40{\%}, 28{\%}, 46{\%}, 60{\%}, and 76{\%}). In contrast, the prevalence of antibody to Helicobacter pylori was relatively constant in all five age groups (20{\%}, 19{\%}, 21{\%}, 25{\%}, and 25{\%}). Serology appears to be an efficient and feasible approach for determining the prevalence of infection with selected waterborne pathogens in very young children. Such an approach may provide a suitable, sensitive, and economical alternative to the cumbersome stool collection methods that have previously been used for evaluation of water and sanitation projects.},

The plume behaviour is tagged 'unusual' since the experience represents the only case where the plume was observed to be heading toward the beach. It is specualted that the odd plume behaviour was the combined result of a northeast wind and the cyclic nature of the current in the area which is greatly influence by the nearby Gulf Stream. Oceanographic and diffusion data were gathered during this experiment including initial dilution of the sewage in rising to the surface, subsequent dispersion, and natural die-off of coliform bacteria. It was found that the lateral spreading rate was enchanced due to oreientation of the plume with respect to the shore},

Our work included a characterization of total microbial communities from the Bay; development of microarrays that identify and quantify the diversity of those communities; and observation of temporal changes in those communities. To identify members of the microbial community, we amplified the 16S rDNA gene from community DNA isolated from a biofilm sample collected from the Chesapeake Bay in February, 2000. The resultant 75 sequences were 95{\%} or more similar to 7 species including two recently described Shewanella species, baltica and frigidimarina, that have not been previously isolated from the Chesapeake. When the genera of bacteria from biofilm after culturing are compared to those detected by subcloning amplified 16S fragments from community DNA, the cultured sample exhibited a strong bias. In oysters collected in February, the most common bacteria were previously unknown. Based on our 16S findings, we are developing microarrays to detect these and other microbial species in these estuarine communities. The microarrays will detect each species using four distinct loci, with the multiple loci serving as an internal control. The accuracy of the microarray will be measured using sentinel species such as Aeromonas species, Escherichia coli, and Vibrio vulnificus. Using microarrays, it should be possible to determine the annual fluctuations of bacterial species (culturable and non-culturable, pathogenic and non-pathogenic). The data may be applied to understanding patterns of environmental change; assessing the health of the Bay; and evaluating the risk of human illness associated with exposure to and ingestion of water and shellfish.},

Once a contamination problem has been defined, the potential user of MST tools must thoroughly consider study objectives before deciding upon a source identifier, a detection method, and an analytical approach to apply to the problem. Regardless of which MST protocol is chosen, underlying assumptions can affect the results and interpretation. It is crucial to incorporate tests of those assumptions in the study quality-control plan to help validate results and facilitate interpretation. Detailed descriptions of MST objectives, protocols, and assumptions are provided in this report to assist in selection and application of MST tools for water-quality investigations. Several case studies illustrate real-world applications of MST protocols over a range of settings, spatial scales, and types of contamination. Technical details of many available source identifiers and detection methods are included as appendixes. By use of this information, researchers should be able to formulate realistic expectations for the information that MST tools can provide and, where possible, successfully execute investigations to characterize sources of fecal contamination to resource waters.},

	annote = {The lower reaches of the Mahoning River in Youngstown, Ohio, have been characterized by the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency (OEPA) as historically having poor water quality. Most wastewater-treatment plants (WWTPs) in the watershed did not provide secondary sewage treatment until the late 1980s. By the late 1990s, the Mahoning River still received sewer-overflow discharges from 101 locations within the city of Youngstown, Ohio. The Mahoning River in Youngstown and Mill Creek, a principal tributary to the Mahoning River in Youngstown, have not met biotic index criteria since the earliest published assessment by OEPA in 1980. Youngstown and the OEPA are working together toward the goal of meeting water-quality standards in the Mahoning River. The U.S. Geological Survey collected information to help both parties assess water quality in the area of Youngstown and to estimate bacteria and inorganic nitrogen contributions from sewer-overflow discharges to the Mahoning River. Two monitoring networks were established in the lower Mahoning River: the first to evaluate hydrology and microbiological and chemical water quality and the second to assess indices of fish and aquatic-macroinvertebrate-community health. Water samples and water-quality data were collected from May through October 1999 and 2000 to evaluate where, when, and for how long water quality was affected by sewer-overflow discharges. Water samples were collected during dry- and wet-weather flow, and biotic indices were assessed during the first year (1999). The second year of sample collection (2000) was directed toward evaluating changes in water quality during wet-weather flow, and specifically toward assessing the effect of sewer-overflow discharges on water quality in the monitoring network. Water-quality standards for Escherichia coli (E. coli) concentration and draft criteria for nitrate plus nitrite and total phosphorus were the regulations most commonly exceeded in the Mahoning River and Mill Creek sampling networks. E. coli concentrations increased during wet-weather flow and remained higher than dry-weather concentrations for 48 hours after peak flow. E. coli concentration criteria were more commonly exceeded during wet-weather flow than during dry-weather flow. Exceedances of nutrient-concentration criteria were not substantially more common during wet-weather flow. The fish and aquatic macroinvertebrate network included Mill Creek and its tributaries but did not include the main stem of the Mahoning River. Persistent exceedances of chemical water-quality standards in Mill Creek and the presence of nutrient concentrations in excess of draft criteria may have contributed to biotic index scores that on only one occasion met State criteria throughout the fish and aquatic macroinvertebrate sampling network. Monitored tributary streams did not contribute concentrations of E. coli, nitrate plus nitrite, or total phosphorus to the Mahoning River and Mill Creek that were higher than main-stem concentrations, but monitored WWTP and sewer-overflow discharges did contribute. Twenty-four hour load estimates of sewer-overflow discharge contributions during wet-weather flow indicated that sewer-overflow discharges contributed large loads of bacteria and inorganic nitrogen to the Mahoning River relative to the instream load. The sewer-overflow loads appeared to move as a slug of highly enriched water that passed through Youngstown on the rising limb of the storm hydrograph. The median estimated sewer-overflow load contribution of bacteria was greater than the estimated instream load by a factor of five or more; however, the median estimated sewer-overflow load of inorganic nitrogen was less than half of the estimated instream load. Sewer-overflow discharges contributed loads of E. coli and nutrients to the Mahoning River and Mill Creek at a point where the streams already did not meet State water-quality regulations. Improvement of water quality of the Mahoning River, Mill Creek, and tributaries at Youngstown would be facilitated by reducing loads from sewer-overflow discharges within Youngstown, by identifying and reducing other sources of E. coli and nutrients within Youngstown, and by reducing discharges of E. coli, nitrate plus nitrite, and total phosphorus to the Mahoning River and Mill Creek upstream from Youngstown.},

In this study, we evaluated two exogenous DNA spike-and-recovery controls as proxies for recovery efficiency of Bacteroidales 16S rDNA gene sequences (AllBac and qHF183) that are used for microbial source tracking (MST) in river water. Two controls---(1) the plant pathogen Pantoea stewartii, carrying the chromosomal target gene cpsD, and (2) Escherichia coli, carrying the plasmid-borne target gene DsRed2---were added to raw water samples immediately prior to concentration and DNA extraction for qPCR. When applied to samples processed in replicate, recovery of each control was positively correlated with the observed concentration of each MST marker. Adjustment of MST marker concentrations according to recovery efficiency reduced variability in replicate analyses when consistent processing and extraction methodologies were applied. Although the effects of this procedure on accuracy could not be tested due to uncertainties in control DNA concentrations, the observed reduction in variability should improve the strength of statistical comparisons. These findings suggest that either of the tested spike-and-recovery controls can be useful to measure efficiency of extraction and recovery in routine laboratory processing.},

	annote = {Surfing is a unique recreational activity with the possibility of elevated risk for contracting gastrointestinal (GI) illness through ingestion of contaminated water. No prior studies have assessed exposure from ingestion among surfing populations. This study estimated the magnitude and frequency of incidental water ingestion using a Web-based survey and integrated exposure distributions with enterococci distributions to predict the probability of GI illness at six Oregon beaches. The mean exposure magnitude and frequency were 170 ml of water ingested per day and 77 days spent surfing per year, respectively. The mean number of enterococci ingested ranged from approximately 11 to 86 colony-forming units (CFU) per day. Exposure-response analyses were conducted using an ingested dose model and two epidemiological models. Risk was characterized using joint probability curves (JPC). At the most contaminated beach, the annualized ingested dose model estimated a mean 9{\%} probability of a 50{\%} probability of GI illness, similar to the results of the first epidemiological model (mean 6{\%} probability of a 50{\%} probability of GI illness). The second epidemiological model predicted a 23{\%} probability of exceeding an exposure equivalent to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) maximum acceptable GI illness rate (19 cases/1000 swimmers). While the annual risk of GI illness for Oregon surfers is not high, data showed that surfers ingest more water compared to swimmers and divers and need to be considered in regulatory and public health efforts, especially in more contaminated waters. Our approach to characterize risk among surfers is novel and informative to officials responsible for advisory programs. It also highlights the need for further research on microbial dose-response relationships to meet the needs of quantitative microbial risk assessments (QMRA).

	annote = {In southern California, storm water runoff from urban watersheds impacts coastal water quality. At the present time, coastal water quality impairments are usually managed through the development and implementation of a total maximum daily load (TMDL) plan, for which waste load allocations (WLA) and load allocations (LA) are developed, respectively, for the primary point and non-point sources of pollution in the watershed. The WLA and LA values are developed after weighing different pollutant source management scenarios, typically with the help of a distributed model of the watershed - for example, the geographical information system (GIS) model called BASINS. Because of challenges associated with this approach, we explore an alternative paradigm for modeling pollutant flow out of large watersheds that we term top-down, as opposed to the bottom-up approach employed by distributed models described above. In this alternative approach, the emphasis is on developing scaling relationships for pollutant loading rates that apply at the scale of large sub-drainages and the watershed as a whole. These scaling relationships could, in principle, be used for engineering calculations (e.g., for the design phase of storm water treatment facilities), to assess the contribution of individual watersheds to coastal pollution, and as a benchmark against which distributed models can be compared and tested. To this end, a series of studies were carried out at three sites in the Santa Ana River watershed, a large urban watershed encompassing in southern California. From the data, fecal indicator bacteria loading rates appear to scale as a power law with volumetric flow in a manner that varies by site, but is robust within, and between, storms at a single site. The physical basis for these scaling relationships, as well as the relationship between contaminants and particles eroded during storm events, are explored and developed. {\copyright}copyright ASCE 2005.},

The concentrations of fecal indicator bacteria and F+ coliphages (viruses infecting E. coli) exhibit little-to-no dependence on streamflow rates, whereas the concentrations of total suspended solids (TSS) exhibit a very strong (power-law) dependence on streamflow rates. The different flow fingerprints observed for fecal pollutants, on one hand, and TSS, on the other hand, reflect different sources and transport pathways for these stormwater constituents. The flow-independent nature of fecal indicator bacteria and F+ coliphages is consistent with the idea that these contaminants are ubiquitously present on the surface of the urban landscape and rapidly partition into the surface water as the landscape is wetted by rainfall. The flow-dependent nature of TSS, on the other hand, is usually ascribed to the shear-induced erosion of channel bed sediments and/or the expansion of drainage area contributing to runoff. The apparent ubiquity of fecal indicator bacteria and F+ coliphages, together with the very high storm-loading rates of fecal indicator bacteria and the low detection frequency of human adenovirus and human enterovirus, suggest that fecal pollution in stormwater runoff from the Santa Ana River watershed is primarily of nonhuman waste origin.},

	annote = {Fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) have long been used as a marker of fecal pollution in surface waters subject to point source and non-point source discharges of treated or untreated human waste. In this paper, we set out to determine the source(s) of elevated FIB concentrations in Cucamonga Creek, a concrete-lined urban stream in southern California. Flow in the creek consists primarily of treated and disinfected wastewater effluent, mixed with relatively smaller but variable flow of runoff from the surrounding urban landscape. Dry and wet weather runoff contributes nearly 100{\%} of FIB loading to Cucamonga Creek, while treated wastewater contributes significant loading of nutrients, including dissolved organic carbon (DOC), phosphorus, nitrate, and ammonium. FIB concentrations are strongly positively correlated with DOC concentration in runoff (Spearman's Ï?≥0.66, P ≤0.037), and microcosm studies reveal that the survival of Escherichia coli and enterococci bacteria in runoff is strongly dependent on the concentration of both DOC and phosphorus. Below threshold concentrations of 7 and 0.07 mg/L, respectively, FIB die off exponentially (die-off rate 0.09 h−1). Above these thresholds, FIB either grow exponentially (growth rate 0.3 h−1) or exhibit a periodic steady-state in which bacterial concentrations fluctuate around some mean value. The periodic steady-state pattern is consistent with a Lotka−Volterra predator−prey oscillation model, and the clearance rate (20 μL predator−1 h−1) obtained by fitting the model to our data is consistent with the hypothesis that predacious protozoa regulate FIB concentrations in runoff at high DOC concentrations. Collectively, these results indicate that FIB impairment of Cucamonga Creek is best viewed as an ecological phenomenon characterized by both bottom-up and top-down control.},

	annote = {Recreational shellfish beds in the Southport Beach area of Southport Harbor, Connecticut are impacted by elevated levels of fecal coliform bacteria. However, the locations and relative magnitudes of the sources of these bacteria have not yet been identified and quantified. In this study, a computer modeling approach to characterize the sources of the bacteria responsible for closure of recreational shellfish beds in Southport Harbor is demonstrated. Field studies provided data to support the modeling and included physical and chemical measurements, bacterial sampling, and dye studies for two suspected sources was conducted to better understand flow in the area and to support the modeling effort. Circulation in Southport Harbor was found to be primarily driven by the tides and secondarily by winds. The tidal response in the harbor is of a mixed standing and progressive wave. The bacteria surveys indicated highest fecal coliform (FC) concentrations in the Mill River and at the mouth of Sasco Brook, locations on either side of the beach area. An integrated hydrodynamic and pollutant transport modeling framework (WQMAP / OILMAP) was used to identify the location and evaluate the bacteria sources responsible for closure of the recreational shellfish beds. The hydrodynamic model was applied to the greater Southport Harbor estuary. The model, which was calibrated to data from the field program, provided temporally and spatially varying currents for use in the subsequent pollutant transport calculations. A Lagrangian (particle-based) approach was used to model pollutant transport both forward and backward in time. In the forward mode the Lagrangian model predicts the evolution of pollutant plumes from specified source locations, while in the backward mode it estimates the likely source locations that would affect a specified end point or resource area, in this case the Southport Beach shellfish bed. Forward transport modeling indicated that pollutants from a distant source (Mill River) were more likely to impact the Southport Beach area than pollutants from an adjacent source (Sasco Brook). Backward mode results from the Lagrangian transport model confirmed that the Mill River was the likely source based on six representative receptor sites located in the beach area. These results indicated that offshore sources might also be significant, but these can be discounted since there are no known sources there. Modeling results thus suggest that control of the more distant Mill River bacteria sources is more likely to improve water quality at Southport Beach than control of the nearby Sasco Brook sources.

Case patients were residents of or visitors to Burdine Township with bloody diarrhea or diarrhea and abdominal cramps occurring between December 15, 1989 and January 20, 1990. Escherichia coli O157 was isolated from 21 stool specimens. All isolates were: resistant to sulfisoxazole, tetracycline, and streptomycin; produced Shiga-like toxins I and II; and, had one 60-megadalton plasmid. Among the 243 case patients, 86 had bloody stools, 32 were hospitalized, 4 died and 2 had the hemolytic uremic syndrome. In the case-control study, no food was associated with illness, but ill persons had drunk more municipal water than had controls (P=0.04). The survey showed that, during the peak of the outbreak, bloody diarrhea was 18.2 times more likely to occur in persons living inside the city and using municipal water than in persons living outside the city and using private well water (P=0.001). Shortly before the peak of the outbreak, 45 water meters were replaced, and two water mains ruptured. The number of new cases declined rapidly after residents were ordered to boil water and after chlorination of the water supply. This was the largest outbreak of ECO157 infections, the first due to a multiply resistant organism, and the first shown to be transmitted by water. System-wide chlorination as well as hyperchlorination during repairs might have prevented this outbreak. Cities with deteriorating water systems using untreated water risk widespread illness from contaminated drinking water.},

	annote = {To demonstrate the value of long-term, water-quality monitoring, the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ), in cooperation with the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), initiated a study to evaluate potential trends in water-quality constituents for selected National Stream Quality Accounting Network (NASQAN) stations in Michigan. The goal of this study is to assist the MDEQ in evaluating the effectiveness of water-pollution control efforts and the identification of water-quality concerns. The study included a total of nine NASQAN stations in Michigan. Approximately 28 constituents were analyzed for trend tests. Station selection was based on data availability, land-use characteristics, and station priority for the MDEQ Water Chemistry Monitoring Project. Trend analyses were completed using the uncensored Seasonal Kendall Test in the computer program Estimate Trend (ESTREND), a software program for the detection of trends in water-quality data. The parameters chosen for the trend test had (1) at least a 5-year period of record (2) about 5 percent of the observations censored at a single reporting limit, and (3) 40 percent of the values within the beginning one-fifth and ending one-fifth of the selected period. In this study, a negative trend indicates a decrease in concentration of a particular constituent, which generally means an improvement in water quality; whereas a positive trend means an increase in concentration and possible degradation of water quality. The results of the study show an overall improvement in water quality at the Clinton River at Mount Clemens, Manistee River at Manistee, and Pigeon River near Caseville. The detected trend for these stations show decreases in concentrations of various constituents such as nitrogen compounds, conductance, sulfate, fecal coliform bacteria, and fecal streptococci bacteria. The negative trend may indicate an overall improvement in agricultural practices, municipal and industrial wastewater-treatment processes, and effective regulations. Phosphorus data for most of the study stations could not be analyzed because of the data limitations for trend tests. The only station with a significant negative trend in total phosphorus concentration is the Clinton River at Mount Clemens. However, scatter-plot analyses of phosphorus data indicate decreasing concentrations with time for most of the study stations. Positive trends in concentration of nitrogen compounds were detected at the Kalamazoo River near Saugatuck and Muskegon River near Bridgeton. Positive trends in both fecal coliform and total fecal coliform were detected at the Tahquamenon River near Paradise. Various different point and nonpoint sources could produce such positive trends, but most commonly the increase in concentrations of nitrogen compounds and fecal coliform bacteria are associated with agricultural practices and sewage-plant discharges. The constituent with the most numerous and geographically widespread significant trend is pH. The pH levels increased at six out of nine stations on all the major rivers in Michigan, with no negative trend at any station. The cause of pH increase is difficult to determine, as it could be related to a combination of anthropogenic activities and natural processes occurring simultaneously in the environment. Trends in concentration of major ions, such as calcium, sodium, magnesium, sulfate, fluoride, chloride, and potassium, were detected at eight out of nine stations. A negative trend was detected only in sulfate and fluoride concentrations; a positive trend was detected only in calcium concentration. The major ions with the most widespread significant trends are sodium and chloride; three positive and two negative trends were detected for sodium, and three negative and two positive trends were detected for chloride. The negative trends in chloride concentrations outnumbered the positive trends. This result indicates a slight improvement in surface-water quality because chloride as a point source in natural water comes from deicing salt, sewage effluents, industrial wastes, and oil fields. For other major ions, such as magnesium and potassium, both positive and negative trends were detected. These changes in trends indicate changes in surface-water quality caused by a variety of point and non-point sources throughout Michigan, as well as natural changes in the environment.},

	annote = {Vassova lagoon is a typical Mediterranean (small, shallow, micro-tidal, well-mixed) coastal lagoon, receiving limited seasonal freshwater inflows from direct precipitation and underground seepage. An intensive study was carried out in order to quantify the mechanisms responsible for the intra-tidal and residual transport of water, salt, nutrients and chlorophyll at the mouth of this lagoon and to assess the lagoon's flushing behavior. Results indicated that although the system is micro-tidal, tidal effects appeared to be the dominant factor for the longitudinal distribution of physical and chemical parameters, while the associated residual flow is also important and serves as a baseline measure of overall circulation. However, analysis of the net longitudinal currents and fluxes of water, salt and nutrients revealed the importance of non-tidal effects (wind effect and precipitation incidents) in the mean tidal transport. It is shown that the Eulerian residual currents transported water and its properties inwards under southern winds, while a seaward transport was induced during precipitation incidents and northern winds. The Stokes drift effect was found an order of magnitude lower than the Eulerian current, directed towards the lagoon, proving the partially-progressive nature of the tide. Nutrients and chlorophyll-αloads are exported from the lagoon to the open sea during the ebb phase of the autumn and winter tidal cycles, associated with the inflow of nutrient-rich freshwater, seeped through the surrounding drainage canal. The reverse transport occurs in spring and early summer, when nutrients enter the lagoon during the flood tidal phase, from the nutrient-rich upper layer of the stratified adjacent sea. Application of a tidal prism model shows that Vassova lagoon has a mean flushing time of 7.5 days, ranging between 4 to 18 days, affected inversely by the tidal oscillation. {\copyright}Springer Science+Business Media, Inc. 2006.},

A common master directive is being written by a joint working-group to ensure comparable implementation in all parts of Germany. An immediate application of the new directive is not possible since the parameter "intestinal enterococci" is currently not routinely monitored.

The mean ratio was 1.9 and 2.0 for the 2 sampling periods. The mean concentration of fecal coliforms was gradually increasing from 2.4/100 ml in May to 7.2/100 ml in September. Conversely the coliphage concentrations were quite uniform during the bathing seasons.

These tests may be inappropriate for analyses of complex industrial effluents such as pulp mill effluents, which may contain bacteria that yield a positive result in fecal and total coliform tests, even though no fecal source exists. Consequently, other more specific indicators for the presence of potential pathogens are needed. In cases where the sources of, or validity of, fecal responses are problematic, the direct examination of pathogens, and/or the use of new source-tracking techniques, such as DNA fingerprinting, may be better approaches for protecting public health.},

Due to their natural occurrence in coastal environments, traditional indicator organisms, such as E. coli, do not predict their presence. This problem has complicated public health initiatives aimed at reducing the impact of illnesses from Vibrio spp. In the U.S., V. vulnificus has received extensive study due to the severity of its disease in humans. Its numbers increase with warmer summer temperature, and decline to nondetectable levels in colder winter months. In environments with salinities greater than 20 ppt, V. vulnificus numbers decline to levels that do not pose human health risks. A similar response to temperature has been observed for pathogenic strains of V. parahaemolyticus, where recent outbreaks of illness have been associated with El Nino weather conditions. In addition, temperature-induced plankton blooms have been linked to epidemic cholera in certain geographical regions of the world. New research shows that seawater temperature and salinity can be used to develop mathematical models of V. vulnificus incidence in coastal environments. Similar efforts might be extended to other Vibrio spp. to develop indicators that predict human health risk, as well as ecosystem integrity.},

River water was collected at two sites (an agricultural area and an industrial area) on the Aigawa River (Osaka, Japan). To facilitate estimation of the physiology of E. coli O157 in natural river water, bacterial cells in the water were stained with 6-carboxyfluorescein diacetate (6CFDA) and propidium iodide (PI). The cells were sorted into two populations, using a flow cytometer, based on their esterase activity. Each population was stained with E. coli O157:H7 fluorescent antibody (FA), and E. coli O157:H7 cells were observed in the esterase-active population. River water samples collected at the same points were incubated with yeast extract containing antibiotics to prevent cell division, and bacterial cells in the incubated samples were stained with PI and FA. Escherichia coli O157:H7 existed in both the viable (elongated and/or fattened) and inactive bacterial population determined by flow cytometry. These results indicate that E. coli O157:H7 may retain metabolic activity and growth potential in the natural aquatic environment.

Shoreline studies of fecal coliform levels have shown that the deep outfalls have not measurably affected water quality at beaches. Recently, monitoring efforts have concentrated on effects to the seafloor environment. At Macaulay Point, sediment chemical levels of concern were confined to within 100 to 400 m of the outfall. Similarly, sediment toxicity was detected at stations up to 400 m from the diffusers. This toxicity was limited to effects on growth and development. Survival was not affected. The benthic infaunal community exhibited a typical response to organic enrichment. Within 100 m of the outfall abundance was increased and richness depressed. At Clover Point sediment chemical levels of concern were confined to within 100 to 200 m of the outfall. Tissue chemistry of resident mussels showed no consistent pattern with distance from the outfall. Some tissue chemicals increased with distance from the diffuser while others decreased.

Water samples were analyzed for Enterococcus densities by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and membrane filtration (MF). This paper investigates the ability of regression models to accurately predict Enterococcus densities above or below a threshold value, using environmental data on a beach-by-beach basis for both methods. The ability to create statistical models for real-time water quality analysis would allow beach managers to make more accurate decisions regarding beach safety. Results from linear regression models indicate that environmental factors explain more of the variability in Enterococcus densities measured by MF than Enterococcus densities measured by qPCR. Results also show that models for both methods did not perform well at predicting occurrences in which water quality levels exceeded a threshold.},

	annote = {The Milwaukee Metropolitan Sewerage District (MMSD) Corridor Study is a three-phase project designed to improve the understanding of water resources in the MMSD planning area to assist managers and policy makers in their decisions. Phase I of the Study involved the compilation of existing data from multiple agencies into a single database. These data were analyzed to identify spatial, temporal, and technological gaps in the planning area, and were used to develop Phase II of the Study. Phase II, the subject of this report, involved an intensive data-collection effort by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) in cooperation with MMSD (from February, 2004, through September, 2005). This phase addressed the data gaps identified in Phase I and completed a baseline assessment of water quality for selected stream and harbor sites in the MMSD planning area. This baseline assessment included evaluations of surface-water chemistry and microbial concentrations in the streams and harbor sites; additionally, stream sites were evaluated for discharge, sediment chemistry, fish-tissue chemistry, habitat, and the quality of biological communities (including fish, macroinvertebrates, and algae). In all, data were collected at 15 stream and 6 harbor sites within the MMSD planning area, including manual sampling and analysis for more than 220 water-quality properties and constituents at all 21 sites, stream-discharge data for 14 stream sites, and automated water-quality sampling at 4 stream sites. A bioassessment during autumn 2004 included collection of biologic-community data and stream-habitat data at wadeable streams. Quartiles of Phase II aggregate bioassessment rankings were used to divide the 14 wadeable stream sites into four groups to investigate relations between bioassessment data and site characteristic and water-quality data. Quartile numbers reflect relative water quality: quartile 1 contained sites where the bioassessment data indicated the least-degraded water quality among those sampled, and quartile 4 contained sites that indicated the most-degraded water quality. Quartiles contained the following stream sites: Quartile 1: Milwaukee River near Cedarburg, Milwaukee River at Milwaukee, Jewel Creek, and Menomonee River at Menomonee Falls; Quartile 2: Willow Creek, Root River near Franklin, and Root River at Grange Avenue; Quartile 3: Menomonee River at Wauwatosa, Oak Creek, and Little Menomonee River; and Quartile 4: Honey Creek, Underwood Creek, Lincoln Creek, and Kinnickinnic River. Site characteristics (in this case, drainage area and land use) and selected water-quality data were summarized based on the four bioassessment quartiles to determine if there were relations with the aggregate bioassessment rankings. In general, sites having the largest drainage basins with the lowest proportion of urban land use were in quartile 1, and the smallest drainage basins with the highest proportion of urban land use were in quartile 4. Major ions, indicator organisms, and wastewater compounds generally had the lowest overall results in quartile 1 and highest overall results in quartile 4, with intermediate results in quartiles 2 and 3. Results for other constituent types (nutrients, mercury, pathogenic organisms, and bed sediment) were mixed, with results for some constituents decreasing from quartile 1 to quartile 4. Where sufficient Phase I data were available, summary statistics (including medians) for chemical and biological data were calculated, allowing some comparisons to be made between Phase I and Phase II data. Comparisons between Phase I and Phase II results indicated a variety of changes with respect to water quality. Concentrations of chloride, nitrate, chlorophyll a, total phosphorus in water; arsenic in bed sediment; and fish Index of Biotic Integrity ratings generally indicated declines in water quality. However, concentrations of total nitrogen, suspended sediment, and fecal coliform in water; some trace elements (cadmium, chromium, copper, lead, mercury, nickel, and zinc) in bed sediment; Ephemeroptera-Plecoptera-Trichoptera taxa and Hilsenhoff Biotic Index ratings indicated improvements in water quality between Phase I and Phase II. Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) were measured in bed sediment (15 sites) and fish tissue (3 sites) to determine if there were changes in concentrations between Phase I and Phase II. PCB contamination of bed sediment and fish tissue was found during both Phase I and Phase II for the Milwaukee River at Milwaukee sampling site. PCB contamination of the Menomonee River at Wauwatosa site was limited to bed sediment during Phase I, but was found in both bed sediment and fish tissue during Phase II. Samples collected at Root River near Franklin contained no detectable concentrations of PCBs in fish tissue or bed sediment (data available for Phase II only). Historically used pesticides were measured in fish tissue at three sites to determine if there were changes in concentrations between Phase I and Phase II. Historically used pesticides were detected in fish tissue at the Milwaukee River at Milwaukee site during Phase I; however Phase II concentrations were less than the Phase I reporting level. Historically used pesticides were also detected in fish-tissue samples at the Menomonee River at Wauwatosa site during Phase II, while none were detected in Phase I. Root River near Franklin had no pesticide detections in fish tissue in Phase I or Phase II.},

Giardiasis is considered to be a re-emerging infection because of its association with outbreaks of diarrhoea in child-care centres. Although only a single species has been recognized as causing disease in humans and most other mammals, molecular characterization of morphologically identical isolates from humans and numerous other species of mammals has confirmed the heterogeneity of this parasite and provided a basis for a clearer understanding of the taxonomy and zoonotic potential of Giardia.},

	annote = {Escherichia coli (EC) concentrations at two beaches impacted by river plume dynamics in southern Lake Michigan were analyzed using three-dimensional hydrodynamic and transport models. The relative importance of various physical and biological processes influencing the fate and transport of EC were examined via budget analysis and a first-order sensitivity analysis of model parameters. The along-shore advective flux of EC (CFU/m2·s) was found to be higher compared to its cross-shore counterpart; however, the sum of diffusive and advective components was of a comparable magnitude in both directions showing the importance of cross-shore exchange in EC transport. Examination of individual terms in the EC mass balance equation showed that vertical turbulent mixing in the water column dominated the overall EC transport for the summer conditions simulated. Dilution due to advection and diffusion accounted for a large portion of the total EC budget in the nearshore, and the net EC loss rate within the water column (CFU/m3·s) was an order of magnitude smaller compared to the horizontal and vertical transport rates. This result has important implications for modeling EC at recreational beaches; however, the assessment of the magnitude of EC loss rate is complicated due to the strong coupling between vertical exchange and depth-dependent EC loss processes such as sunlight inactivation and settling. Sensitivity analysis indicated that solar inactivation has the greatest impact on EC loss rates. Although these results are site-specific, they clearly bring out the relative importance of various processes involved.},

	annote = {The quantity of salmonella, fecal coliform bacteria and fecal streptococci was measured in 2003 water samples from North Sea coastal water, drainage canals, the lower River Ems and sewage works. The presence of salmonella did not correlate to an increasing presence of fecal indicator bacteria. In several cases more than 10(3) salmonella per litre were found in samples whose fecal coliform levels met the strictest quality requirements (in accordance with the levels stipulated by EEC bathing water regulations). Additionally 226 marine sediment samples were measured for their content of salmonella only. While salmonella were present in 12.3{\%} of at least 1 litre of the North Sea water samples (bathing places excepted) and in about 7{\%} of sediment samples (10 g), no salmonella were traced in 400 samples from marine water bathing places. The general contamination with salmonella of sea water bathing places can therefore be regarded as low. More frequent occurrences on the beaches must be seen as the result of a concrete case of contamination or other disturbance. The serovarieties of the salmonella isolated from North Sea and Ems waters indicate in comparison with isolations from sewage works, infected humans and calves from the region that the contamination of the local coastal water mainly stems from sewage works and could also on a small scale be caused by sea birds. Salmonella from agricultural sources proved to be irrelevant in this study. Molecular biological examinations of the plasmid profiles for example could give more precise informations. The establishment of serovarieties which are relatively unimportant for human medicine (eg. S. mbandaka) in sewage works, drainage canals and the North Sea reveal the problem involved in evaluating such finds in bathing water samples, because in EEC regulations no differentiation or quantification is made.},

False positive and false negative results are commonly found. There is a need for the development of more rapid low-cost techniques for determining microbiological water quality. A method has been developed to analyze large volumes of pristine tropical waters for the presence of coliphages. It involves the filtration of water through positively charged filters and an elution step. The eluent is then mixed with nutrient agar and incubated. Water samples were analyzed from a rain forest, ranging from pristine river waters and water collected from bromeliads (epiphytic vegetation), to recreational rivers. Total and fecal coliforms as well as fecal streptococci levels detected were higher than recommended standards for fecal contamination of waters. Bacteriophages have been detected only in recreational waters, but not from bromeliads or pristine waters. These data suggest a correlation between the presence of phages and fecal contamination.

Responses were compared to those of beachgoers at the unaffected Laguna Main Beach. No significant differences were found in risk perception. Respondents were aware of the closures (83{\%}), yet the majority (83{\%}) felt the water was safe for swimming. Proximity of residence to the beach was strongly associated with closure awareness (Spearman's Ï?=0.427, p<0.0001). Although 83{\%} of respondents felt that water quality was important in deciding to go to the beach, only 25{\%} of respondents who did not plan to swim cited pollution or contamination as a reason not to swim. Most respondents (70{\%}) trusted local health agency officials' decisions about when to open/close beaches. Surveyed beach visitors were likely to bathe (84{\%}) and were not highly concerned with swimming-related health risks. {\copyright}2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Assumptions regarding spatial and temporal bathing patterns were used to determine exposure levels over a 31-month study period. Illness rates were calculated by applying previously reported relationships between enterococcus density and HCGI risk to the exposure data. Peak enterococcus concentrations occurred in late winter and early spring, but model results showed that most HCGI cases occurred during summer, attributable to elevated number of exposures. Approximately 99{\%} of the 95,010 illness cases occurred when beaches were open. Model runs were insensitive to 0-10{\%} swimming activity assumed during beach closure days. Comparable illness rates resulted under clustered and uniform bather distribution scenarios. HCGI attack rates were within federal guidelines of tolerable risk when averaged over the study period. However, tolerable risk thresholds were exceeded for 27 total days and periods of at least 6 consecutive days. Illness estimates were sensitive to the functional form and magnitude of the enterococcus density-HCGI relationships. The results of this study contribute to an understanding of recreational health risk in coastal waters.},

	annote = {Considerable investment has been made in recent years in improvements to the microbiological quality of urban wastewater discharges to surface waters, particularly in coastal towns, with the aim of reducing the exposure of bathers and surfers to gastrointestinal pathogens. As this source of pollution has come under greater control, attention has started to focus on diffuse catchment sources of faecal contamination which have been shown to be dominant during high river flows associated with storm events. This association with storm events suggests that rapidly responding hydrological pathways such as overland flow are likely to be important. The aim of this paper is to establish the current state of knowledge of pathogen transport processes in overland flow. In addition, the paper will attempt to convey the way that soil erosion science may aid our understanding of this environmental problem. The scale and nature of faecal waste applications to land in the UK is briefly reviewed, with data presented on both livestock slurry and manure, and human sewage sludge. Particular emphasis is placed on factors influencing the likelihood of pathogens making their way from infected livestock and humans to the soil surface, and therefore the chances of them being available for transport by overland flow. The literature relating to pathogen transport in overland flow is reviewed. Existing pathogen transport models treat pathogens as particles and link pathogen transport models to pathogen die-off kinetics. Such models do not attempt to describe the interactions that may occur between pathogens and soil and waste particles. Although conceptual models describing the possible states in which pathogen transport may occur have been proposed, an understanding of the factors controlling the partitioning of the microorganisms between the different states is only just beginning to emerge. The apparent poor performance of overland flow mitigation measures such as grass buffer strips in controlling the movement of faecal indicators highlights the need for a better understanding the dynamics of microbial transport so that better management approaches may be developed. Examples of on-going research into overland flow transport processes are briefly described and gaps in knowledge identified.},

Fecal coliform levels in the Mississippi Sound have been analyzed and compared with physical factors in an attempt to characterize possible nonpoint sources of pollution. Results from this study show that a primary factor in elevated levels of fecal coliform is a change in wind direction. The passage of warm and cold fronts through the northern Gulf of Mexico causes numerous 90$\,^{\circ}$-180$\,^{\circ}$shifts in wind directions over a period of 6-8 days. Commonly, a rise in fecal coliform counts is observed at coastal monitoring stations after an abrupt shift in wind direction and wind speed. When these trends of increased fecal coliform levels occur before rainfall, it is inferred that the sediment could be a source of the fecal coliform observed in the water column. The changes in wind direction and velocity might induce more energetic conditions at the shoreline (e.g., increased wave heights and increased longshore current velocities). Fecal coliform counts collected from five monitoring stations along the Harrison County, Mississippi, coast during 2002-2003 have been compared with wind, wave, and current records from within the Mississippi Sound. The occurrence of high fecal coliform counts at multiple stations can be correlated with higher energy events in the Sound. Statistically, wind direction and high bacterial counts are correlated, and higher counts are most likely to occur when the winds are out of the west or southwest at most stations.},

Methods and Results:PCR primers for the nifH gene of M. smithii were designed, tested and used to detect the presence or absence of this organism in faecal and environmental samples. Specificity analysis showed that the Mnif primers amplified products only in M. smithii pure culture strains (100{\%}), human faeces (29{\%}), human sewage samples (93{\%}) and sewage-contaminated water samples (100{\%}). No amplification was observed when primers were tested against 43 bacterial stock cultures, 204 animal faecal samples, 548 environmental bacterial isolates and water samples from a bovine waste lagoon and adjacent polluted creek. Sequencing of PCR products from sewers demonstrated that a 222-bp product was the nifH gene of M. smithii. The minimal amount of total DNA required for the detection of M. smithii was 10 ng for human faeces, 10 ng for faecally contaminated water and 5 ng for sewage. Recreational water seeded with M. smithii established a lower detection limit of 13 cells ml super(-1). Conclusions:The Mnif assay developed during this investigation showed successful detection of M. smithii in individual human faecal samples, sewage and sewage-contaminated water but not in uncontaminated marine water or bovine-contaminated waters. The Mnif assay appears to be a potentially useful method to detect sewage-polluted coastal waters. Significance and Impact of the Study:This study was the first to utilize methanogens as an indicator of sewage pollution. Mnif PCR detection of M. smithii was shown to be a rapid, inexpensive and reliable test for determining the presence or absence of sewage pollution in coastal recreational waters.},

A deterministic computer model has been developed which is capable of simulating existing conditions under a complete set of seasonal scenarios, and able to predict the pollution potential due to alternative land uses. The model is a hybrid model which combines conventional surface runoff solutions with newly created groundwater outflow quantification techniques. Linkage is provided for coupling the freshwater inflow model with estuary mixing and flushing models. Adapted to the readily available IBM microcomputer, the model provides a valuable management tool for use by the three towns situated along the watershed in their evaluation of land use practices and the effectiveness of possible solutions.},

An automated plate reader allows for earlier and repeated measurements and can distinguish treatment effects after only six hours of incubation, compared with the overnight incubation for the conventional. assay. Using this rapid MST assay, a known-source Escherichia coli (E. coli) antibiotic resistance pattern database was constructed for the Black River watershed in southeastern Michigan. The average rate of correct classification for the known-source database was 70.4{\%} when comparing each of seven specific animal sources, 72.5{\%} when comparing three generic animal groups (human, waterfowl, and livestock), and 88.9{\%} when comparing human to non-human animal sources. The rapid assay and database were then used to identify the sources of E coli at a public recreational beach as human (34{\%}), goose (34{\%}), and cattle (20{\%}). {\copyright}Copyright by the North American Lake Management Society 2006.},

These methods were used in the analyses of wastewater samples to investigate their feasibility as alternatives to current fecal indicator bacteria culture methods for predicting the efficiency of viral pathogen removal by standard treatment processes. PMA treatment was effective in preventing qPCR detection of target sequences from non-viable cells. Concentrates of small volume, secondary-treated wastewater samples, collected from a publicly owned treatment works (POTW) under normal operating conditions, had little influence on this effectiveness. Higher levels of total suspended solids, such as those associated with normal primary treatment and all treatment stages during storm flow events, appeared to interfere with PMA effectiveness under the sample preparation conditions employed. During normal operating conditions at three different POTWs, greater reductions were observed in PMA-qPCR detectable target sequences of both Enterococcus and Bacteroidales than in total qPCR detectable sequences. These reductions were not as great as those observed for cultivable fecal indicator bacteria in response to wastewater disinfection. Reductions of PMA-qPCR as well as total qPCR detectable target sequences from enterococci and, to a lesser extent, Bacteroidales correlated well with reductions in infectious viruses during both normal and storm flow operating conditions and therefore may have predictive value in determining the efficiency at which these pathogens are removed.},

Contrary to previous results, however, C. parvum oocysts were not inactivated by ECO, and the reasons for this difference are uncertain. The on-site electrolytic generation of oxidants from brine provided a convenient and inexpensive disinfectant containing free chlorine that was effective against many enteric microbes, for the treatment of household and community drinking-water supplies worldwide.

	annote = {Campylobacter is the leading cause of bacterium-associated diarrhea in the United States and most developed countries. While this disease is considered a food-borne disease, many clinical cases cannot be linked to a food source. In rural and agrarian areas environmental transmission may be an important factor contributing to case loads. Here we investigated the waterborne prevalence of campylobacters in a mixed-use rural watershed in the coastal plain of southern Georgia (United States). Six sites representing various degrees of agricultural and human influence were surveyed biweekly to monthly for 1 year for the presence of culturable thermophilic campylobacters and other measures of water quality. Campylobacters were frequently present in agriculture-and sewage-impacted stretches of streams. The mean campylobacter counts and overall prevalence were highest downstream from a wastewater treatment plant that handled both human and poultry slaughterhouse waste (≤595 CFU ml -1; 100{\%} positive); the concentrations were significantly higher than those for the four upstream sites (P < 0.05). The counts were significantly correlated with the number of fecal coliform bacteria, conductivity, pH, and concentrations of nutrients (NO3-, PO43-, and NH3). Campylobacters were isolated more frequently and larger numbers were present during the summer months, similar to the occurrence of clinical cases of campylobacteriosis in this region. A multivariate model showed that the levels were significantly influenced by increasing precipitation, which also peaked in the summer. The results indicate that loading from both human and domestic animal waste may be high in the watershed studied during the summer months. Mixed-use watersheds supporting agriculture production, human populations, and wildlife may be at risk for contamination by campylobacters and may be an important route for human exposure.

The eight investigated sites follow a gradient of soil development on coastal dune sand. Abundance of microfauna increased from sandy beach to forest and heath sites, dividing the sites into two distinct groups of successional stages: the young sites (beach, primary and white dune/grey dune) and the more mature sites (old grey dune, shrub, dune heath, and forest). The content of organic matter in soil, also influencing water conditions and pH, was the main factor with respect to abundance of all microfaunal groups. Testaceans were highly dominant in all sites except the beach and account for up to 95 {\%} of the total microfauna abundance. While ciliates were more abundant than nematodes in the young soils, the latter became more important in the soils with an accumulation of organic matter, where also rotifers occurred in higher numbers. The investigated microfaunal groups represent the higher trophic levels of the microtrophic system. The results show an increasing complexity of food web interactions and more trophic levels in older sites than in early successional stages. The changes in the soil properties and the energy source lead to a shift in the food web structure from bacterial dominated to detritus dominated nutrition and a higher amount of fungal feeding during soil development.}

Enterococci qPCR and culture values were not significantly different for a given treatment (P > 0.05, paired t-test) and both assays showed differences in biosolid treatment effectiveness---anaerobic digestion treatments averaged 5--5.5 log genomic units (GU) and colony forming units (CFU)/dry g while composting decreased enterococci on average to 3.7 log GU and 3.8 log CFU/dry g. Only in class A TPAD biosolids dewatered with a belt-filter press were culture values significantly lower than qPCR values (1.7 log CFU/dry g vs. 5 GU/dry g). Further investigation of compost inactivation was compared for enterococci and other fecal indicators (n = 5 treatment plants)---the enterococci indicator was more resistant to compost treatment than fecal coliforms, with reductions averaging only 1--2.5 logs for enterococci, male-specific coliphages, and sulfite-reducing Clostridia while 5-log reductions were observed for fecal coliforms. Lastly, biosolid isolates from culture-based methods were identified using DNA sequencing---these results revealed that non-enterococci, including Bacillus spp. and Vagococcus spp., were commonly isolated from compost and TPAD biosolids using mEI agar. Given the equivalency of culture- and qPCR-based enterococci concentrations in biosolids and the more conservative inactivation noted for both assays during class A composting, the use of enterococci qPCR monitoring could bypass non-specificity issues with culture-based methods while providing an improved description of pathogen fate in biosolids.},

Acute dissolved iron and manganese problems have been encountered in downstream water supplies, partially alleviated by a portion of a coffer dam left in place 375 ft above the turbine penstocks. Downstream water temperatures are not significantly altered by the impoundment, probably due to partial blockage of colder hypolimnetic water by the submerged coffer dam (the top edge is 50 ft below the water surface). No problem is foreseen in meeting fecal coliform standards for recreational water quality; nor are there major problems with pesticides or toxic metals.

In this study, the method of detecting Bacteroides phages as specific markers of sewage contamination in Hawaii's recreational waters was evaluated because these sewage specific phages cannot multiply under environmental conditions. Bacteroides hosts (GB-124, GA-17), were recovered from sewage samples in Europe and were reported to be effective in detecting phages from sewage samples obtained in certain geographical areas. However, GB-124 and GA-17 hosts were ineffective in detecting phages from sewage samples obtained in Hawaii. Bacteroides host HB-73 was isolated from a sewage sample in Hawaii, confirmed as a Bacteroides sp. and shown to recover phages from multiple sources of sewage produced in Hawaii at high concentrations (5.2--7.3 ×105 PFU/100 mL). These Bacteroides phages were considered as potential markers of sewage because they also survived for three days in fresh stream water and two days in marine water. Water samples from Hawaii's coastal swimming beaches and harbors, which were known to be contaminated with discharges from streams, were shown to contain moderate (20--187 CFU/100 mL) to elevated (173--816 CFU/100 mL) concentrations of enterococci. These same samples contained undetectable levels (<10 PFU/100 mL) of F+ coliphage and Bacteroides phages and provided evidence to suggest that these enterococci may not necessarily be associated with the presence of raw sewage. These results support previous conclusions that discharges from streams are the major sources of enterococci in coastal waters of Hawaii and the most likely source of these enterococci is from environmental soil rather than from sewage.},

FC and FS loads in a primary stream running through the farm were estimated at up to four stations (above the farm, above the steading, below the farm and below a pre-existing 0.6 ha area of open water/wetland), in summer 2004 and 2005. During this period, steading and field mitigation measures were being installed. We estimated that farm FC loads likely to cause bathing water failure were 8.9×108 colony-forming units (cfu) ha-1 d-1 (guideline standards) and 1.7×1010 cfu ha-1 d-1 (mandatory standards). In 2005, the guideline exceedance risk (42{\%}) was associated about equally with field and steading sources, whereas the mandatory exceedance risk (11{\%}) was mainly due to steading sources. The pond/wetland below the farm reduced these exceedance risks to 20{\%} and <1{\%}, respectively, but was a source of FS at high discharge. The exceedence curves below the farm were similar in 2004 and 2005, despite lower flows and installation of pollution mitigation measures. The results suggest that further mitigation efforts on this farm should be focused on improving management of the steading FC sources and that wetlands to receive steading runoff can be cost:effective mitigation tools for faecal indicator pollution.

We therefore investigated batch growth in microcosms containing different types of sterile freshwater. The water samples were inoculated with low starting cell concentrations of E. coli O157 (3 x 103 cells ml-1) and growth was followed using nucleic acid staining combined with flow cytometry. We demonstrated that E. coli O157 is able to grow in sterile freshwater at low carbon concentrations, which is against the common view that cell numbers decline over time when added to freshwater samples. A correlation between apparent assimilable organic carbon (AOCapp) concentration and the final cell concentration reached by E. coli O157 was established (P < 0.01). A considerable fraction of the AOCapp (34 +/- 13%) was used by E. coli O157 but the numerical cell yield was about five-times lower in comparison with the bacterial AOC-test community, which originated from natural freshwater. On average, the maximum specific growth rate (umax) of E. coli O157 growing in sterile freshwater at 30$\,^{\circ}$C was 0.19 +/- 0.07 h-1. Batch growth assays at five different temperatures revealed a positive influence of temperature on umax of E. coli O157. The results give new information on the behaviour of this common pathogen in the aquatic environment and contribute to microbial risk assessment in order to prevent spreading of water-borne diseases.},

Serial trials were carried out at a clean and at a relatively polluted beach over weekends. Participants were recruited at the beach, at which time information on swimming status and sociodemography was obtained. This provided for a beach-going but non-swimming control group. Symptoms which developed subsequent to the beach visit were obtained by follow-up telephone interviews conducted 3-4 days later. Water samples collected on trial days both before and during maximum swimming activity, were analysed for enterococci, faecal coliforms, staphylococci, coliphages and F-male-specific bacteriophages. Significant differences in the indicator levels at the beaches were observed. An excess in gastro-intestinal, respiratory and skin symptoms were found among swimmers relative to non-swimmers at the polluted beach. Although not statistically significant, the results are suggestive of a relationship between swimming-associated illness and water quality. The study demonstrated the feasibility of the methodology and the results of the overall programme will form the basis for the development of epidemiologically derived recreational water quality criteria for South African beaches.},

This delay leads to potentially inaccurate management decisions regarding beach safety. We evaluated the quantitative polymerase chain reaction (QPCR) as a faster method to assess recreational water quality and predict swimming-associated illnesses. METHODS: We enrolled visitors at 4 freshwater Great Lakes beaches, and contacted them 10 to 12 days later to ask about health symptoms experienced since the visit. Water at the beaches was polluted by point sources that carried treated sewage. We tested water samples daily for Enterococcus using QPCR and membrane filtration (EPA Method 1600). RESULTS: We completed 21,015 interviews and tested 1359 water samples. Enterococcus QPCR cell equivalents (CEs) were positively associated with swimming-associated gastrointestinal (GI) illness (adjusted odds ratio per 1 log10 QPCR CE =1.26; 95{\%} confidence interval = 1.06-1.51). The association between GI illness and QPCR CE was stronger among children aged 10 years and below (1.69; 1.24-2.30). Nonenteric illnesses were not consistently associated with Enterococcus QPCR CE exposure, although rash and earache occurred more frequently among swimmers. Enterococcus QPCR CE exposure was more strongly associated with GI illness than Enterococcus measured by membrane filtration. CONCLUSIONS: Measurement of the indicator bacteria Enterococci in recreational water using a rapid QPCR method predicted swimming-associated GI illness at freshwater beaches polluted by sewage discharge. Children at 10 years or younger were at greater risk for GI illness following exposure.},

Methods to measure recreational water quality in less than or equal to 2 hr have been developed. Application of rapid methods could give considerably more accurate and timely assessments of recreational water quality. We conducted a prospective study of beachgoers at two Great Lakes beaches to examine the association between recreational water quality, obtained using rapid methods, and gastrointestinal (GI) illness after swimming. Beachgoers were asked about swimming and other beach activities and 10-12 days later were asked about the occurrence of GI symptoms. We tested water samples for Enterococcus and Bacteroides species using the quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method. We observed significant trends between increased GI illness and Enterococcus at the Lake Michigan beach and a positive trend for Enterococcus at the Lake Erie beach. The association remained significant for Enterococcus when the two beaches were combined. We observed a positive trend for Bacteroides at the Lake Erie beach, but no trend was observed at the Lake Michigan beach. Enterococcus samples collected at 0800 hr were predictive of GI illness that day. The association between Enterococcus and illness strengthened as time spent swimming in the water increased. This is the first study to show that water quality measured by rapid methods can predict swimming-associated health effects.},

These findings support the position that reservoirs can be used jointly for water supply and for recreational purposes. Such recreational use must, however, be intelligently managed. Primary water contact areas, such as marinas and swimming beaches, should be closely and intelligently monitored and controlled in order to minimize the hazards to both the recreationist and the domestic consumer arising from excessive density of use. In addition, these high density use areas should be located such that they are well removed from those areas of the lake from which water is withdrawn. This practice would serve to not only protect the quality of the intake water, but would in addition eliminate the need for additional treatment precautions. The implementation of these practices would allow multiple use programs to create many new recreational sites in areas where those recreational sites already in existence are sorely overburdened and threatened with destruction through overuse.},

	annote = {Escherichia coli is an important member of the gastrointestinal tract of humans and warm-blooded animals (primary habitat). In the external environment outside the host (secondary habitat), it is often considered to be only a transient member of the microbiota found in water and soil, although recent evidence suggests that some strains can persist in temperate soils and freshwater beaches. Here we quantified the population genetic structure of E. coli from a longitudinal collection of environmental strains isolated from six freshwater beaches along Lake Huron and the St. Clair River in Michigan. Multilocus enzyme electrophoresis (MLEE) and multilocus sequence typing (MLST) revealed extensive genetic diversity among 185 E. coli isolates with an average of 40 alleles per locus. Despite evidence for extensive recombination generating new alleles and genotypic diversity, several genotypes marked by distinct MLEE and MLST profiles were repeatedly recovered from separate sites at different times. A PCR-based phylogrouping technique showed that the persistent, naturalized E. coli belonged to the B1 group. These results support the hypothesis that persistent genotypes have an adaptive advantage in the secondary habitat outside the host. {\copyright}2007 The Authors.},

The model is applied to an 11 km reach of the Clyde estuary in Scotland and has been developed as part of a larger study into the dispersal and survival of indicator bacteria in coastal and estuarine waters. The model consists of a finite element solution to the advection-dispersion equation with decay which interacts with a finite difference solution to the hydrodynamic equations. The hydrodynamic model has been verified using water level data and measurements of flow velocity, and the conservative version of the solute model has been calibrated approximately using salinity measurements. The hydrodynamic model is shown to perform well, but the solute model remains unverified at the time of writing due to a shortage of appropriate salinity data. The values of the dispersion coefficient used in the model, however, are shown to be consistent with values estimated from measurements of the flow structure. Other work has yielded values for the mortality or decay rate appropriate to Escherichia coli bacteria in estuarine waters which, when used with the nonconservative version of the solute transport model, will enable a bacterial concentration model to be calibrated.

However, a thorough understanding of the persistence of genetic markers in environmental waters is lacking. In the present study, we evaluate the persistence of enterococci, enterovirus, and human-specific Bacteroidales in seawater microcosms. Two microcosms consisted of seawater seeded with human sewage. Two additional seawater microcosms were seeded with naked Enterococcus faecium DNA and poliovirus RNA. One of each replicate microcosm was exposed to natural sunlight; the other was kept in complete darkness. In the sewage microcosms, concentrations of enterococci and enterovirus were measured using standard culture-dependent methods as well as QPCR and RT-QPCR respectively. Concentrations of human-specific Bacteroidales were determined with QPCR. In the naked-genome microcosms, enterococci and enterovirus markers were enumerated using QPCR and RT-QPCR, respectively. In the sewage microcosm exposed to sunlight, concentrations of culturable enterococci fell below the detection limit within 5 days, but the QPCR signal persisted until the end of the experiment (day 28). Culturable enterococci did not persist as long as infectious enteroviruses. The ability to culture enteroviruses and enterococci was lost before detection of the genetic markers was lost, but the human-specific Bacteroidales QPCR signal persisted for a similar duration as infectious enteroviruses in the sewage microcosm exposed to sunlight. In the naked-genome microcosms, DNA and RNA from enterococci and enterovirus, respectively, persisted for over 10 d and did not vary between the light and dark treatments. These results indicate differential persistence of genetic markers and culturable organisms of public health relevance in an environmental matrix and have important management implications.},

The survival characteristics of a mixture of five nalidixic acid-resistant E. coli O157:H7 strains (103 CFU/ml) in filtered and autoclaved municipal water, in reservoir water, and in water from two recreational lakes were determined for a period of 91 days at 8, 15, or 25$\,^{\circ}$C. Greatest survival was in filtered autoclaved municipal water and least in lake water. Regardless of the water source, survival was greatest at 8$\,^{\circ}$C and least at 25$\,^{\circ}$C. E. coli O157:H7 populations decreased by 1 to 2 log10 by 91 days at 8$\,^{\circ}$C, whereas the pathogen was not detectable (≥3 log10 decrease) within 49 to 84 days at 25$\,^{\circ}$C in three of the four water sources. SDS-PAGE of surface antigens of surviving cells revealed that there was no major alteration in lipopolysaccharide pattern, but outer membrane protein composition did change. These studies indicate that E. coli O157:H7 is a hardy pathogen that can survive for long periods of time in water, especially at cold temperatures. However, direct viable counts of E. coli O157:H7 determined by acridine orange staining remained essentially the same for 12 weeks at 25$\,^{\circ}$C, whereas viable counts on tryptic soy agar plates decreased to undetectable levels within 12 weeks. Results suggest that E. coli O157:H7 can enter a viable but nonculturable (VBNC) state in water.},

Despite the fact that there are potentially many methods to evaluate water safety, finding a simple, rapid, versatile, and inexpensive method for detection of toxins in everyday items is still a great challenge. In this study, we extend the concept of composites, impregnated porous fibrous materials, such as fabrics and papers, by single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs), toward very simple but high-performance biosensors. They utilize the strong dependence of electrical conductivity through nanotubes percolation network on the width of nanotube−nanotube tunneling gap and can potentially satisfy all the requirements outlined above for the routine toxin monitoring. An antibody to the microcystin-LR (MC-LR), one of the common culprits in mass poisonings, was dispersed together with SWNTs. This dispersion was used to dip-coat the paper rendering it conductive. The change in conductivity of the paper was used to sense the MC-LR in the water rapidly and accurately. The method has the linear detection range up to 10 nmol/L and nonlinear detection up to 40 nmol/L. The limit of detection was found to be 0.6 nmol/L (0.6 ng/mL), which satisfies the strictest World Health Organization standard for MC-LR content in drinking water (1 ng/mL) and is comparable to the detection limit of the traditional ELISA method of MC-LR detection, while drastically reducing the time of analysis by more than an order of magnitude, which is one of the major hurdles in practical applications. Similar technology of sensor preparation can also be used for a variety of other rapid environmental sensors.},

The goals and accomplishments were as follows: GOALS * Expand the past city recreational beach monitoring program to develop data-driven criteria for beach closures by evaluating a combination of rapid and sensitive tests for the detection of microbial indicators and pathogenic microorganisms * Develop a rapid and sensitive method for the detection of pathogenic E. coli 0157:H7 * Apply coliphage genotyping to determine the source of fecal contamination. * Apply sensitive tests for the detection of pathogens responsible for enteric illness: Giardia, Cryptosporidia, Salmonella and E. coli 0157:H7 * Determine the correlations between (1) existing environmental monitoring parameters, (2) occurrence of pathogens, and (3) meteorological, physical and water quality data collected by remote automated monitoring stations * Consider mathematical constructs for modeling pathogen occurrence * Develop innovative partnerships with community groups and agencies to facilitate dissemination of water quality data and beach closure decisions * Construct a water quality database with dynamic query capability for ready access to the public ACCOMPLISHMENTS * The study focused on developing and applying innovative environmental monitoring tools for the detection of emerging pathogens and novel microbial indicator microorganisms combined with realtime monitoring of environmental conditions, and development of an effective communication infrastructure for dissemination of data to the public. The project provided an enhanced ability to provide real time, user friendly, state-of-the-art water quality information to the public. * A large database of indicator and pathogen occurrence at inland beaches serving a major population center in the Northern Midwest was created. The collected data was loaded into Progress and Oracle databases. The continuously monitored data was made available on the world-wide-web within an hour of collection and the microbial indicator data following the completion of the analyses. The remaining microbiological analysis results were included on the web after analysis results were finalized. * Additional pages educate and explain the significance of the collected data to the public. * Changes in water quality information were disseminated via media, beach signs and a telephone hotline. * A new sensitive analytical method for detecting E. coli 0157:H7 in recreational waters was developed, modified and implemented. The usability of the method was evaluated. * Public education regarding recreational water quality issues was accomplished by poster presentations (at City-County Office building and lake side), informational materials on the web, during neighborhood fairs and through neighborhood newsletters and display of information in a kiosk at the beach. * Quantitative relationships between microbial indicator data, occurrence of pathogens, and meteorological, physical and water quality data were sought to create a predictive model for real-time assessment of the risk of pathogen occurrence and beach closure decisions. The modeling effort showed that none of the indicators was able to represent the presence or absence of pathogens. However, the bacterial indicator densities showed a strong statistically significant association with 2 some environmental parameters. The predictive model used real-time environmental data as predictors for bacterial densities when they exceeded the closure limits.},

The primary focus of the database is to support environmental research focused on tidal creek watershed systems. Specifically, the current data holdings include physical water quality parameters, nutrients, pathogens, chemical contaminants, benthic and nekton species abundances and human dimensions data from Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina dating to 1994. These data are not from a single long-term research project but are derived from several state and federal research programs and integrated into a common database model to support current research being conducted under the OHHI program at HML. The Tidal Creek database was developed with the intent to support a well documented and open system, thus metadata elements from common metadata standards including the Dublin Core ISO 15836:2003 and Federal Geographic Data Committee (FGDC-STD-001-1998) are components of the database model. The result is a semantic database framework with descriptive ancillary data at the record level including methods, investigator names, date, locations and other descriptive elements. The primary users of the database are project personnel to meet analytical needs. The database is also available through a number of web-based applications that are designed to give users the necessary information to evaluate and access data. In addition, data can be accessed with Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) standards, and species records and abundances are being made available to the Ocean Biogeographic Information System (OBIS).

While there are few Australian case studies, the early stages of an ongoing study at Dodges Ferry, Tasmania, show a connection between shallow aquifer quality, number of residences and domestic on-site wastewater disposal practices. Of 26 groundwater samples analysed, a number fail to meet established criteria for potable use. Most samples were highly or very highly saline. This renders them unpalatable and has an adverse impact on vegetation if the water is used for irrigation. Several samples had pH less than 6.0 and those taken from shallow wells were discoloured by leached soil organic matter. Elevated nitrate levels, an indicator of contamination by sewage effluents, were found at nine locations and these were usually associated with small clusters of residences. One very high sample was clearly contaminated by effluent from an adjacent on-site wastewater disposal system. One odorous, black organic seep was found at the foot of the dunes backing a bathing beach and this gives cause for concern that failing on-site wastewater disposal systems are contributory to reduced bathing water quality. Faecal coliforms and Escherichia coli were not found, even in samples with the highest nitrate concentrations, suggesting that residence time has been sufficient for bacterial die-off. Contamination of shallow aquifers is greatest where there is a high density of residences with small lots.},

Previously, fecal indicator bacteria (Escherichia coli and enterococci) were shown as incidental contaminants in pitcher fluid; however, whether their occurrence in pitcher fluid is incidental or common has not been established. The purpose of this study was to investigate the occurrence, distribution, and growth potential of E. coli and enterococci in pitcher plant fluid from a protected bog in northwest Indiana. Escherichia coli and enterococci were recovered in pitcher fluids (n=43 plants), with mean densities (log CFU mL-1) of 1.28+/-0.23 and 1.97+/-0.27, respectively. In vitro experiments showed that E. coli growth in fluid not containing insects or indigenous organisms was directly proportional to the fluid concentration (growth was 10-fold in 24 h in 100{\%} fluid); however, in the presence of other indigenous organisms, E. coli and enterococci were only sustained for 5 days at 26 degrees C. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) analysis showed that the plant Enterococcus faecalis isolates were genetically distinct from the human isolates; identical PFGE patterns were observed among plant isolates that fell into one of six clonal groups. These findings suggest that (i) E. coli and enterococci occurrence in pitcher plants is rather common in the bog studied, although their originating source is unclear, and (ii) the pitcher fluid contains adequate nutrients, especially carbon and energy sources, to promote the growth of indicator bacteria; however, under natural conditions, the biotic factors (e.g., competition for nutrients) may restrict their growth.},

Currently, beach contamination study approaches tend to be site-specific under the belief that politically delineated beaches are unique and management of beaches cannot be regionally oriented. E. coli data collected over five years from 23 Chicago beaches clearly identified ambient linked patterns at the regional scale. Temporal fluctuations were similar, with all beaches having simultaneous peaks and troughs of E. coli concentrations. Spatially, E. coli concentrations for beaches more closely situated were more closely correlated, indicating spatial autocorrelation. Julian day, wave height, and barometric pressure explained up to 40% of the variation,avalue comparable to individual, less parsimonious sitespecific models. Day of sampling could explain the majority of the variation in E. coli concentrations, more so than beach, depth, or time of day. Comparing beaches along a targeted coastline allows a better understanding of inherent background regional fluctuations and, ultimately, better predictions of E. coli concentrations in coastal recreational water.},

E. coli data were collected at 29 beach locations along both sides of the peninsula, at Washington Island, within Sturgeon Bay, and at inland lakes. Additionally, several beaches were more intensively sampled on several occasions, including Ephraim, Fish Creek, Otumba, Sister Bay, and Whitefish Dunes beaches. Spatial sampling (depth of water and location on the beach) was conducted at these beaches typically three days a week throughout the summer sampling period. Ambient conditions in the field were recorded, including wind conditions, number of gulls present on the beach, and abundance of amassed Cladophora algae along the shoreline. Daily rainfall data were collected at 3 locations on the peninsula: Sturgeon Bay, Egg Harbor, and Sister Bay. Additional ambient weather data were collected at a NOAA-operated buoy located at the north end of Lake Michigan, near the north end of the Door County peninsula. This report includes a descriptive analysis of the dataset collected for Door County; it includes comparisons of E. coli results from the beaches. It also provides analysis of the spatial sampling and comparisons of E. coli counts with ambient conditions. Analysis of rainfall effects on E. coli are included, with several rainfall sampling events examined intensively. Land use, beach slope, beach substrate, and sampling location were also considered relative to E. coli counts at certain beaches. Finally, regression and predictive modeling was explored for groups of Door County beaches to determine what parameters could be used as surrogates for E. coli.},

	title = {Examination of the watershed-wide distribution of Escherichia coli along Southern Lake Michigan: an integrated approach},
	annote = {Recent research has highlighted the occurrence of Escherichia coli in natural habitats not directly influenced by sewage inputs. Most studies on E. coli in recreational water typically focus on discernible sources (e.g., effluent discharge and runoff) and fall short of integrating riparian, nearshore, onshore, and outfall sources. An integrated "beachshed" approach that links E. coli inputs and interactions would be helpful to understand the difference between background loading and sewage pollution; to develop more accurate predictive models; and to understand the differences between potential, net, and apparent culturable E. coli. The objective of this study was to examine the interrelatedness of E. coli occurrence from various coastal watershed components along southern Lake Michigan. The study shows that once established in forest soil, E. coli can persist throughout the year, potentially acting as a continuous non-point source of E. coli to nearby streams. Year-round background stream loading of E. coli can influence beach water quality. E. coli is present in highly variable counts in beach sand to depths just below the water table and to distances at least 5 m inland from the shore, providing a large potential area of input to beach water. In summary, E. coli in the fluvial-lacustrine system may be stored in forest soils, sediments surrounding springs, bank seeps, stream margins and pools, foreshore sand, and surface groundwater. While rainfall events may increase E. coli counts in the foreshore sand and lake water, concentrations quickly decline to prerain concentrations. Onshore winds cause an increase in E. coli in shallow nearshore water, likely resulting from resuspension of E. coli-laden beach sand. When examining indicator bacteria source, flux, and context, the entire "beachshed" as a dynamic interacting system should be considered.},

At 63rd St. Beach, Chicago, Ill., factors influencing the daily periodicity of culturable E. coli, particularly insolation, were examined. Water samples for E. coli analysis were collected twice daily between April and September 2000 three times a week along five transects in two depths of water. Hydrometeorological conditions were continuously logged: UV radiation, total insolation, wind speed and direction, wave height, and relative lake level. On 10 days, transects were sampled hourly from 0700 to 1500 h. The effect of sunlight on E. coli inactivation was evaluated with dark and transparent in situ mesocosms and ambient lake water. For the study, the number of E. coli samples collected (n) was 2,676. During sunny days, E. coli counts decreased exponentially with day length and exposure to insolation, but on cloudy days, E. coli inactivation was diminished; the E. coli decay rate was strongly influenced by initial concentration. In situ experiments confirmed that insolation primarily inactivated E. coli; UV radiation only marginally affected E. coli concentration. The relationship between insolation and E. coli density is complicated by relative lake level, wave height, and turbidity, all of which are often products of wind vector. Continuous importation and nighttime replenishment of E. coli were evident. These findings (i) suggest that solar inactivation is an important mechanism for natural reduction of indicator bacteria in large freshwater bodies and (ii) have implications for management strategies of nontidal waters and the use of E. coli as an indicator organism.},

We examined the transferability of Escherichia coli and F+ coliphage (MS2) from beach sand to hands in order to estimate the potential subsequent health risk. Sand with high initial E. coli concentrations was collected from a Chicago beach. Individuals manipulated the sand for 60 seconds, and rinse water was analysed for E. coli and coliphage. E. coli densities transferred were correlated with density in sand rather than surface area of an individual's hand, and the amount of coliphage transferred from seeded sand was different among individuals. In sequential rinsing, percentage reduction was 92{\%} for E. coli and 98{\%} for coliphage. Using dose-response estimates developed for swimming water, it was determined that the number of individuals per thousand that would develop gastrointestinal symptoms would be 11 if all E. coli on the fingertip were ingested or 33 if all E. coli on the hand were ingested. These results suggest that beach sand may be an important medium for microbial exposure; bacteria transfer is related to initial concentration in the sand; and rinsing may be effective in limiting oral exposure to sand-borne microbes of human concern.},

E. coli concentrations within streams may be reduced by intervening ponds or wetlands through a number of physical and biological means. A section of Dunes Creek, a small coastal stream of southern Lake Michigan, was impounded and studied for 30 months from pre-through post-construction of the experimental pond. E. coli reduction became more predictable and effective with pond age. E. coli followed the hydrograph and increased several-fold during both rainfall and snowmelt events. Seasonally, the pond was more effective at reducing E. coli during summer than winter. Late summer, non-solar reduction or inactivation of E. coli in the pond was estimated at 72{\%} and solar inactivation at 26{\%}. E. coli DNA fingerprinting demonstrated that the winter population was genetically more homogeneous than the summer population. Detection of FRNA coliphages suggests that there was fecal contamination during heavy rain events. An understanding of how environmental factors interact with E. coli populations is important for assessing anticipated contaminant loading and the reduction of indicator bacteria in downstream reaches.},

	annote = {Background: It would be inappropriate to use the percentile values for intestinal enterococci (IE) and Escherichia coli (EC) in Annex I of the new European bathing water directive 2006/7/EEC for the health-related classification of single sample results. Method: To provide guidance for a health-related interpretation of single sample results it was calculated which percentage of the bathers would probably be exposed above the epidemiologically verified thresholds of effect or No Observed Adverse Effect Levels (NOAELs) for gastroenteritis if a single sample result is interpreted as the median value of the distribution of microbial concentrations that is present in the bathing water on the sampling day. Results: If a representative sample from a bathing water reveals a concentration above ca. 250 IE/100 ml or above ca. 1,000 EC/ 100 ml, it may be assumed that on that sampling day >99{\%} of the bathers were exposed to concentrations above the epidemiologically verified NOAEL of 25 IE/1 100 ml or 10 EC/100 ml. For any other result below these concentrations the corresponding percentage can be read off a table or calculated using a simple formula. Conclusions: The calculation of the probability of being exposed to concentrations above a threshold of effect (NOAEL) transforms concentrations of indicator organisms, which in and of themselves cannot be interpreted, into meaningful figures which can easily be understood by the consumer. Thus, beach managers, supervising authorities, non governmental organisations, and political decision makers are provided with guidance for the interpretation of monitoring results, which may assist them in justifying intervention measures (beach warnings, beach closures etc.) and the repeal of such measures, and in initiating remedial actions if necessary. Action limits for health protection interventions should by no means be higher than 250 IE/100 ml or 1,000 EC/100 ml.},

A total of 2,196 participants were recruited from the local population and randomized into bathers and non-bathers. Bathers were exposed for 10 min and had to immerse their head at least three times. Water samples for microbiological analysis were collected at 20-min intervals. Unbiased concentration-response effects with no-observed-adverse-effect levels (NOAELs) were demonstrated for three different definitions of gastroenteritis and four fecal indicator organisms. Relative risks for bathing in waters with levels above NOAELs compared with nonbathing ranged from 1.8 (95{\%} CI, 1.2-2.6) to 4.6 (95{\%} CI, 2.1-10.1), depending on the definition of gastroenteritis. The effect of swallowing water provided additional evidence for true dose-response relationships. Based on the NOAELs, the following guide values for water quality are suggested: 100 Escherichia coli, 25 intestinal enterococci, 10 somatic coliphages, or 10 Clostridium perfringens per 100 mL. Recreational water quality standards are intended to protect the health of those consumers who are not already immune or resistant to pathogens that may be associated with indicator organisms. In contrast to current World Health Organization recommendations, we concluded that standards should be based on rates of compliance with NOAELs rather than on attributable risks determined above NOAELs, because these risks depend mainly on the unpredictable susceptibility of the cohorts. Although in theory there is no threshold in real concentration-response relationships, we demonstrated that a NOAEL approach would be a more robust and practical solution to the complex problem of setting standard.},

From a presidential initiative, EPA's administrator Carol Browner created (May 23, 1997) a new- Beaches Environmental Assessment, Closure, and Health (BEACH) Watch Program-as a collaborative project developed by EPA and its Office of Water. The BEACH program was accelerated with the help of EPA's Environmental Monitoring for Public Access and Community Tracking (EMPACT) Program-working closely with NOAA and the U.S. Geological Survey. The BEACH program's goal is to significantly reduce the risk of water-borne illness at U.S. beaches and recreational waters through improvements in protection programs, risk communication, and scientific advances. The main goal of the EMPACT program, which supports the BEACH program, is to provide useful information to the public about the quality of recreational waters and help for local health and environmental agencies to strengthen and improve the consistency of their water quality programs. The right of the public to know if the beach and coastal waters are safe is discussed.

The potential impact of riverine sources of pollution was first confirmed after a study in 1997. The completion of sewerage system enhancements offered the potential for the study of faecal indicator delivery from upstream sources comprising both point sources and diffuse agricultural sources. A research project to define these elements commenced in 2001. Initially, a desk study reported here, estimated the principal infrastructure contributions within the Ribble catchment. A second phase of this investigation has involved acquisition of empirical water quality and hydrological data from the catchment during the 2002 bathing season. These data have been used further to calibrate the 'budgets' and 'delivery' modelling and these data are still being analysed. This paper reports the initial desk study approach to faecall indicator budget estimation using available data from the sewerage infrastructure and catchment sources of faecal indicators. {\copyright}IWA Publishing 2005.},

	annote = {To ensure optimum quality at Bathing Waters, the control of diffuse sources of bacterial contamination is receiving increasing attention. As part of an initiative to improve the quality of the EU designated bathing waters on the Fylde Coast (North West England), a project was undertaken to quantify the faecal indicator load from birds and assess the significance on water quality. High bird counts are encountered on the Fylde Coast with gulls, ferall pigeons and starlings being prominent. The piers at Blackpool make an attractive roost for starlings with numbers peaking at over 30,000 in late summer. Systematic recording of bird numbers and locations was undertaken during 2001/2. Estimates were also made of the daily faecal organism production by the different species. The spatial distribution of faecal organisms from the bird population was statistically linked to synoptic water quality data. This allowed estimates to be made of the contribution from birds to the faecal pollution load at the bathing waters. The work confirmed a statistically significant link between bird populations and water quality with a marked seasonal bias. {\copyright}IWA Publishing 2005.},

	abstract = {PLS-regression (PLSR) is the PLS approach in its simplest, and in chemistry and technology, most used form (two-block predictive PLS). PLSR is a method for relating two data matrices, X and Y, by a linear multivariate model, but goes beyond traditional regression in that it models also the structure of X and Y. PLSR derives its usefulness from its ability to analyze data with many, noisy, collinear, and even incomplete variables in both X and Y. PLSR has the desirable property that the precision of the model parameters improves with the increasing number of relevant variables and observations. This article reviews PLSR as it has developed to become a standard tool in chemometrics and used in chemistry and engineering. The underlying model and its assumptions are discussed, and commonly used diagnostics are reviewed together with the interpretation of resulting parameters. Two examples are used as illustrations: First, a Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR)/Quantitative Structure-Property Relationship (QSPR) data set of peptides is used to outline how to develop, interpret and refine a PLSR model. Second, a data set from the manufacturing of recycled paper is analyzed to illustrate time series modelling of process data by means of PLSR and time-lagged X-variables.},

In the Great Lakes region the indicator used is Escherichia coli and for 2007 more beaches were closed and impacted than ever before. In this study, water quality was addressed at two Lake Michigan Beaches over the 2004 swimming season by monitoring infectious enteric viruses by cell culture and integrated PCR and for a human sewage marker based on the Enterococcal Surface Protein (esp). Our goals for this study were to 1) examine the occurrence and variety of human enteric viruses present during peak usage of the beaches 2) determine key variables for development of predictive models for viruses; and 3) use quantitative risk assessment to estimate the potential health impact. Our results demonstrate that for both beaches predictive models of virus pollution were best described utilizing physical parameters like wind speed, wind direction and water temperature. The esp marker was not predictive of human viruses. The daily risk of acquiring a viral infection at either of the beaches ranged from 0.2 to 2.4/1000 swimmers using a quantitative microbial risk assessment model, with three swims during a day at the beach for children and over the season, the risk was 9--15/1000 swimmers using adenovirus as the model. Conclusions: Lake Michigan recreational beaches are being adversely impacted by human fecal pollution. Monitoring for the traditional indicators of water quality does not address viral risks and models can be developed and potentially used as real-time water quality forecasting tools.},

The properties of the soil (high amounts of metal oxides, kaolinitic clay), unsaturated flow conditions, and relatively high ionic strengths of the leaching solution attributed to significant retention of these indicators.

However, there are some disadvantages in these microbial techniques including time consuming (18-48h) and inability in discriminating between human and animal fecal material sources. Therefore, it is necessary to seek a more specific indicator of human sanitary waste. In this study, the feasibility was investigated to apply caffeine and human pharmaceutical compounds to identify the human-source contamination. The correlation between caffeine and fecal coliform was also explored. Surface water samples were collected from upstream, middle-stream and downstream points respectively, along Rochor Canal, as well as 8 locations of Marina Bay. Results indicate that caffeine is a suitable chemical tracer in Singapore because of its easy detection (in the range of 0.30-2.0 ng/mL), compared with other chemicals monitored. Relative low concentrations of human pharmaceutical compounds (< 0.07 ng/mL) in Rochor Canal and Marina Bay water samples make them hard to be detected and difficult to be chemical tracer. However, their existence can help to validate sewage contamination. In addition, it was discovered the high correlation exists between caffeine concentration and fecal coliform density in the Rochor Canal water samples, demonstrating that caffeine is highly related to the human-source contamination.},

	annote = {Quantitative guidelines with respect to indicator organism densities in recreational waters that have been established by the U. S. EPA have been supported by human health studies, notably those performed in the late 40's and early 50's by the U.S. Public Health Service, and in the 70's and early 80's by the U.S. EPA. Upper limits of 35 enterococci per 100 mL in marine water and 33 enterococci per 100 mL in freshwater were recommended for the geometric mean of at least fi ve samples taken over a 30-day period [U.S. EPA, 1986]. An upper limit on the geometric mean of 126 E. coli per 100 mL was recommended for freshwater environments only, since E. coli failed to show a good relationship to swimming-associated illnesses in marine waters. A recommendation was also made that, for a designated public beach, no single sample exceed the 75th percentile of a lognormal distribution with these respective geometric means. Lacking site-specifi c log standard deviations, this implied an upper limit on any single sample of 104 enterococci per 100 mL in marine water (log standard deviation of 0.7), and 98 enterococci or 235 E coli per 100 mL in freshwater (log standard deviation of 0.4). Providing numerical guidelines that are supported by scientifi c data was a great advance. Lacking, however, was scientifi c data of comparable quality to support monitoring schemes that would provide the most meaningful information about whether the guidelines are being met. The EMPACT (Environmental Monitoring for Public Access and Community Tracking) Beaches project has attempted to identify those characteristics of a beach environment that have signifi cant impact on monitoring. This project examined fi ve beach environments to determine the factors that most infl uence the measurement of beach water quality. Two ocean beaches, an estuarine beach, a Great Lakes beach, and a riverine beach were selected to provide as broad a representation of beach environments as possible. This approach was used to develop model protocols that can be applied to similar beaches. Factors found to infl uence indicator levels For each of the fi ve study beaches, the greatest single determinant of microbial indicator level was found to be the depth zone, or, roughly, distance from the shoreline at which the sample was collected. Bacterial densities became substantially lower as one moved from ankle-deep to knee-deep to chestdeep water. This fact has important implications for sample design as well as for public health. In contrast, this study found no signifi cant difference in indicator level among samples that were taken at different depths below the surface, such as between those taken the standard 0.3 M from the surface and those taken from near the bottom. At three of the fi ve beaches, no substantial systematic differences were found among samples taken at different points parallel to the beachfront, which spanned a distance of 60 M, as long as they came from water of the same depth. Minor ``hot spots'' and ``cold spots'' were found at two of the beaches, although the differences were not dramatic and were not consistently found at all times. Signifi cant declines in indicator densities from the morning to the afternoon (9:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m.) were observed at four of the study beaches. This effect was seen only on sunny days at one freshwater beach, but was observed to be independent of sunshine at three others, a freshwater beach and two marine beaches. Indicator levels at the remaining beach, a West Coast marine environment, tended to be very low at all times. From one day to the next, the geometric mean indicator density among all samples that were collected changed by a factor of 2 (doubling or halving) or more about half the time at each studied beach. 2 There was virtually zero correlation between the indicator level on any given day and the indicator level more than two days later. The geometric mean of fi ve samples taken over a 29-day period (that is, on the same day of the week) did not accurately represent actual conditions on any given day during the 29-day period. Findings from this study with regard to spatial and temporal variation suggest the following implications for a beach monitoring program: * Time and location of sampling must be carefully considered. o Depth zones from which samples are collected are likely to have great effect on the resulting estimate of indicator density. Sampling in knee- to waist-deep water would seem to offer a reasonable, but still conservative, approach to estimating water quality, particularly given that health effects are based on quality of water at waist-depth or deeper. o Sampling at 0.3 M below the surface is justifi ed based on exposure considerations. This study failed to discern differences at lower collection depths. o Sampling in the morning will likely be a conservative practice, in addition to perhaps being a convenient time to sample. o Sampling should be performed as close as practical to the day on which a decision is to be made regarding beach closure or advisement. Preferably this should be the day before, given current conditions of a one day turnaround for the results. * A number of samples should be collected from different points in knee- to waist-deep water. o Results from the EMPACT Beaches Study can be used as a guideline for the initial determination of sample size requirements. For the beaches in this study, sample sizes of from 3 to 6 would be adequate to allow for 95% certainty of detecting a 0.3 log exceedence from the action level for the geometric mean, equivalent to a health risk of 3 to 3.5 cases of HCGI per 1000 swimmers. o As data are gathered, the sampling plan should be refi ned and ultimately based on a variance estimate that is uniquely associated with the subject beach. * ``Hot spots'' within the bathing area, which may be known a priori or discovered as a result of sampling, should be considered as separate strata for sampling purposes. o These should be sampled independently and weighted appropriately in the fi nal result. o If indicator density within the problem area is very different from that elsewhere, sampling should be limited to this area. A proposed rule-of-thumb is a two-fold difference. o Lesser differences would warrant a combined, stratifi ed estimate, weighting the ``hot spot'' in proportion to its extent relative to the rest of the beachfront. * Composite sampling may be used as a cost-effi cient technique, enabling better sample coverage at minimally increased cost. o In the initial stages of a monitoring program, composite sampling should not be used in order to develop data that is necessary in estimating the appropriate sampling variance for a particular beach. o A composite sample estimates an arithmetic mean, which would require adjustment in order to equate this to standards based on a geometric mean. o If resources are available to collect the data necessary for developing a predictive model for the change in indicator density over a 24 hour period, this will likely result in muchimproved assessment of water quality, given the 1-day lag in obtaining results from membrane fi ltration assays.},

	annote = {The subject paper describes a procedure for adjusting a risk model based upon a measure of personal exposure (the "UK personal exposure model") in order to attribute an expected rate of gastroenteritis among a group of swimmers to a mean recreational water quality value (enterococci per 100mL). We term the resulting model for group risk the "UK ecologic exposure model." The distinction is essential to establishing recreational water quality guidelines because exposures of individual bathers are not known from a water monitoring program, the only assessment available being some form of ecologic exposure such as a mean log indicator density. While the authors of the subject paper solved the UK ecologic exposure model for only a single point (that value of mean log10 enterococcus density which is expected to result in five extra cases of gastroenteritis per 100 swimmers), we extend their model to show the entire curve over a relevant range of densities. The resulting exposure-response curve is seen to not differ substantially from the existing USEPA model for "highly credible gastrointestinal illness" in marine waters. However, particularly since such correspondence is not guaranteed for future studies or for other existing epidemiological studies, we recommend the direct approach to evaluating ecologic exposure, such as used in the USEPA studies, rather than the indirect approach of the UK ecologic exposure model, given the number of untested assumptions that are necessary for accomplishing the latter.},

There were 28 species representing genera: Candida, Cryptococcus, Geotrichum, Kloeckera, Rhodotorula, Saccharomyces, and Trichosporon. The most common species were Rhodotorula glutinis and Candida guilliermondii. The density of the population of identified species depended on the season and sampling site and ranged from 80 to 328000 cells/dm3 (also uncountable growth).

However, HAdV occurrence at recreational freshwater beaches has not been previously investigated. In this study, a total of 58 water samples were collected from two recreational beaches on Lake Michigan (i.e., Silver Beach and Washington Park Beach) during the summer of 2004. Occurrences of HAdVs in these lake samples were determined using two hexon-based real-time PCR assays (one for monitoring all 51 serotypes of HAdVs and another for specifically detecting F species HAdVs, i.e., serotypes 40 and 41) and compared to an integrated cell culture (ICC) PCR method. The real-time PCR results showed that 8 of 30 Silver Beach samples and 6 of 28 Washington Park Beach samples contained HAdVs, and F species HAdVs were detected in three of these positive samples. The concentrations of HAdVs ranged from (1.7 $\pm$0.7) ×101 to (3.4 $\pm$0.8) ×102 and from (7 $\pm$2) ×100 to (3.8 $\pm$0.3) ×103 virus particles/liter for Silver Beach and Washington Park Beach, respectively. F species HAdVs were detected at levels ranging from (4.8 $\pm$0.8) ×101 to (4.6 $\pm$1.5) ×102 virus particles/liter. Approximately 60{\%} of the ICC-PCR analyses agreed with the real-time PCR results. This study revealed the occurrence of HAdVs at Lake Michigan recreational beaches. Given the potential health risks, further assessment regarding sources, virus transport, and survival is needed to improve the safety of the region.

By constructing the tank, the City aimed to decrease the beach closing frequency during the swimming season and prevent the Lake water from directly discharged urban runoff and CSOs. In this study, field data from a 5-year runoff quantity monitoring program (220 events monitored from 1995 to 1999) and a one year runoff quality monitoring program (46 samples collected in 1996) are analyzed to evaluate the tank performance on both runoff quantity control and quality control. Observed results on runoff quantity control of the system show that the original design objectives are far from being achieved. The eight hour detention period helps to reduce pollutants such as TSS, heavy metals, and nutrients but is not long enough for bacterial decay. Conclusions are drawn on the current performance of the tank and on the utility of field monitoring results.},

	annote = {Fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) are nearly ubiquitous in California (CA) beach sands. Sands were collected from 55 beaches along the CA coast. Ninety-one percent of the beaches had detectable enterococci (ENT) while 62{\%} had detectable E. coli (EC) in their sands. The presence of a putative bacterial source (such as a river), the degree of wave shelter, and surrounding land use explained a significant (p < 0.05) fraction of the variation in both ENT and EC densities between beaches. Sand characteristics including moisture content, organic carbon, and percentfines, significantly (p < 0.05) influenced only EC densities in beach sand. We assayed 34 of 163 sand samples for salmonellae, but did not detect this bacterial pathogen. The potential for FIB to be transported from the sand to sea was investigated at a single wave-sheltered beach with high densities of ENT in beach sand: Lovers Point, CA (LP). We collected samples of exposed and submerged sands as well as water over a 24 h period in order to compare the disappearance or appearance of ENT in sand and the water column. Exposed sands had significantly higher densities of ENT than submerged sands with the highest densities located near the high tide line. Water column ENT densities began low, increased sharply during the first flood tide and slowly decreased over the remainder of the study. During the first flood tide, the number of ENT that entered the water column was nearly equivalent to the number of ENT lost from exposed sands when they were submerged by seawater. The decrease in nearshore ENT concentrations after the initial influx can be explained by ENT die-off and dilution with clean ocean water. While some ENT in the water and sand at LP might be of human origin because they were positive for the esp gene, others lacked the esp gene and were therefore equivocal with respect to their origin. Follow-up sampling at LP revealed the presence of the human specific Bacteroides marker in water and sand. {\copyright}2007 American Chemical Society.},

Previous work identified beach sands as reservoirs of enterococci which can be transported from the sand to the sea, where they may instigate beach advisories. The present study establishes that naturally occurring enterococci can replicate in beach sands under environmentally relevant conditions. In unseeded, nonsterile microcosm experiments, it was shown that intermittent wetting of sands by seawater, like that which would occur at the high tide line, stimulates the transient replication of enterococci at rates of 0.20 to 0.63 per day (equivalent to doubling times of 1.1 to 3.5 days). Replication was not observed in control microcosms that were not subjected to wetting. Enterococci were enumerated using both culture-dependent (membrane filtration and mEI media) and culture-independent (quantitative PCR {$[$}QPCR{$]$}, 23S rRNA gene based) techniques, which allowe! d tracking of both culturable and total enterococcus populations. Inhibition of QPCR and DNA extraction efficiencies were accounted for in the interpretation of the QPCR results. The results provide evidence that enterococci may not be an appropriate indicator of enteric disease risk at recreational beaches subject to nonpoint sources of pollution.},

While several genotypic techniques have been used to determine potential sources of fecal bacteria impacting waterways and beaches, they do not allow for the rapid analysis of a large number of samples in a relatively short period of time. Here we report that gene probes identified by Hamilton and colleagues (M. J. Hamilton, T. Yan, and M. J. Sadowsky, Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 72:4012-4019, 2006) were useful for the development of a high-throughput and quantitative macroarray hybridization system to determine numbers of E. coli bacteria originating from geese/ducks. The procedure we developed, using a QBot robot for picking and arraying of colonies, allowed us to simultaneously analyze up to 20,736 E. coli colonies from water samples, with minimal time and human input. Statistically significant results were obtained by analyzing 700 E. coli colonies per water sample, allowing for the analysis of approximately 30 sites per macroarray. Macroarray hybridization studies done on E. coli collected from water samples obtained from two urban Minnesota lakes and one rural South Carolina lake indicated that geese/ducks contributed up to 51{\%} of the fecal bacteria in the urban lake water samples, and the level was below the detection limit in the rural lake water sample. This technique, coupled with the use of other host source-specific gene probes, holds great promise as a new quantitative microbial source tracking tool to rapidly determine the origins of E. coli in waterways and on beaches.

However, as limitations with the use of coliforms have become apparent and the applications for indicator microorganisms have expanded, new indicators have been proposed and, in some cases, adopted, for specific purposes, as discussed in detail in a number of recent reports (i.e., National Research Council, 2004; World Health Organization, 2003).},

	annote = {PROBLEM/CONDITION: Since 1971, CDC, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists have collaboratively maintained the Waterborne Disease and Outbreak Surveillance System for collecting and reporting data related to waterborne-disease outbreaks (WBDOs) associated with drinking water. In 1978, WBDOs associated with recreational water (natural and treated water) were added. This system is the primary source of data regarding the scope and effects of disease associated with recreational water in the United States. In addition, data are collected on individual cases of recreational water-associated illnesses and infections and health events occurring at aquatic facilities but not directly related to water exposure. REPORTING PERIOD: Data presented summarize WBDOs and case reports associated with recreational water use that occurred during January 2005--December 2006 and previously unreported disease reports and outbreaks during 1978--2004. DESCRIPTION OF THE SYSTEM: Public health departments in the states, territories, localities, and the Freely Associated States (i.e., the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, and the Republic of Palau, formerly parts of the U.S.-administered Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands) have primary responsibility for detecting, investigating, and voluntarily reporting WBDOs to CDC. Although the surveillance system includes data for WBDOs and cases associated with drinking water, recreational water, and water not intended for drinking, only cases and outbreaks associated with recreational water and health events at aquatic facilities are summarized in this report. RESULTS: During 2005--2006, a total of 78 WBDOs associated with recreational water were reported by 31 states. Illness occurred in 4,412 persons, resulting in 116 hospitalizations and five deaths. The median outbreak size was 13 persons (range: 2--2,307 persons). Of the 78 WBDOs, 48 (61.5{\%}) were outbreaks of gastroenteritis that resulted from infectious agents or chemicals; 11 (14.1{\%}) were outbreaks of acute respiratory illness; and 11 (14.1{\%}) were outbreaks of dermatitis or other skin conditions. The remaining eight were outbreaks of leptospirosis (n = two), primary amebic meningoencephalitis (n = one), and mixed or other illnesses (n = five). WBDOs associated with gastroenteritis resulted in 4,015 (91.0{\%}) of 4,412 illnesses. Fifty-eight (74.4{\%}) WBDOs occurred at treated water venues, resulting in 4,167 (94.4{\%}) cases of illness. The etiologic agent was confirmed in 62 (79.5{\%}) of the 78 WBDOs, suspected in 12 (15.4{\%}), and unidentified in four (5.1{\%}). Thirty-four (43.6{\%}) WBDOs had a parasitic etiology; 22 (28.2{\%}), bacterial; four (5.1{\%}), viral; and two (2.6{\%}), chemical or toxin. Among the 48 gastroenteritis outbreaks, Cryptosporidium was confirmed as the causal agent in 31 (64.6{\%}), and all except two of these outbreaks occurred in treated water venues where Cryptosporidium caused 82.9{\%} (29/35) of the gastroenteritis outbreaks. Case reports associated with recreational water exposure that were discussed and analyzed separately from outbreaks include three fatal Naegleria cases and 189 Vibrio illnesses reported to the Cholera and Other Vibrio Illness Surveillance System. For Vibrio reporting, the most commonly reported species were Vibrio vulnificus, V. alginolyticus, and V. parahaemolyticus. V. vulnificus illnesses associated with recreational water exposure had the highest Vibrio illness hospitalization (77.6{\%}) and mortality (22.4{\%}) rates. In addition, 32 aquatic facility-related health events not associated with recreational water use (e.g., pool chemical mixing accidents) that occurred during 1983--2006 were received from New York. These events, which caused illness in 364 persons, are included in this report but analyzed separately. INTERPRETATIONS: The number of WBDOs summarized in this report and the trends in recreational water-associated disease and outbreaks demonstrate a substantial increase in number of reports from previous years. Outbreaks, especially the largest ones, occurred more frequently in the summer at treated water venues and caused gastrointestinal illness. Deficiencies leading to WBDOs included problems with water-quality, venue design, usage, and maintenance. Case reports of illness associated with recreational water use expand our understanding of the scope of waterborne illness by further underscoring the contribution of less well-recognized swimming venues (e.g., oceans) and illness (e.g., nongastrointestinal illness). Aquatic facilities are also a focus for injuries involving chemicals or equipment used routinely in the operation of swimming venues, thus illustrating the lack of training of some aquatics staff. PUBLIC HEALTH ACTIONS: CDC uses WBDO surveillance data to 1) identify the etiologic agents, types of aquatic venues, water-treatment systems, and deficiencies associated with outbreaks and case reports; 2) evaluate the adequacy of efforts (i.e., regulations and public awareness activities) to provide safe recreational water; 3) expand the scope of understanding about waterborne disease and health events associated with swimming and aquatics facilities; and 4) establish public health prevention priorities, data, and messaging that might lead to improved regulations, guidelines, and prevention measures at the local, state, and federal levels.},

Ninety six samples each of wet and dry sand and seawater were collected and analysed for fecal indicator bacteria. A parasitological examination and Candida albicans analysis were also performed in sand samples and F-specific bacteriophages were determined in seawater. Statistical analysis of the results demonstrated higher concentrations of fecal coliforms and fecal streptococci in dry sand during summer. Correlation analysis indicated a significant relationship between fecal indicator densities in wet sand and seawater. There was a significant correlation between the densities of fecal coliforms and fecal streptococci for both types of sand, and this correlation was higher in wet sand. Cysts and eggs of parasites were detected in 4.2{\%} of the samples and Candida albicans was isolated in 18{\%} of the samples. The high concentrations of fecal indicators detected in sand during summer demonstrate that there is a health risk to the users of these recreational areas and suggest the necessity of some criteria for microbiological control. Preventive measures, such as education campaings and some management actions are important precautionary measures.},

Patterns of distribution of the indicator organism, E. coli, in the sand at these beaches are now being investigated as a source of E. coli to adjacent beach water. This project investigates the concentrations of E. coli in beach sand, and the relationship between these sand-microbe concentrations and concentrations of microbes in the corresponding beach water. Weekly sampling of upshore, swash, and submerged sand at six beaches provided numbers of the indicator bacteria in each beach's sand substrate for two consecutive summers. Overall concentrations of E. coli were highest in the swash sand of the beach, with the highest numbers seen in the summer months and lowest numbers in the winter months. Each location had very different concentrations of E. coli in the beach sand from 1,800 CFU/100 g to 21,670 CFU/100 g sand. Each location had a very different relationship between the indicator organism found in the beach sand and that found in the beach water. These data suggest that sand may be a reservoir for E. coli at some locations, and another source of contamination that should be considered in beach monitoring programs. However, elevated levels of E. coli in beach sand were not universal and varied greatly from location to location.},

Free chlorine concentrations of 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 ppm at 23$\,^{\circ}$C were evaluated, with sampling times at 0, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 min. Results revealed that five of six E. coli O157:H7 isolates and the E. coli control strain were highly susceptible to chlorine, with > 7 log10 CFU/ml reduction of each of these strains by 0.25 ppm free chlorine within 1 min. However, comparatively, one of the seven strains was unusually tolerant to chlorine at 23$\,^{\circ}$C for 1 min, with a 4-, 5.5-, 5.8-, and > 5.8-log CFU/ml reduction at free chlorine concentrations (ppm) of 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0, respectively. Based on these studies most isolates of E. coli O157:H7 have no unusual tolerance to chlorine; however, one strain was exceptional in being recovered after 1-min of exposure of 107 CFU/ml to 2.0 ppm of free chlorine. This isolate may be a useful reference strain for future studies on chlorine tolerance of E. coli O157:H7.},

Viable but nonculturable (VBNC) E. coli are living cells that are dormant and not culturable using standard microbiological cultivation methods. This study reports a comparison between the mTEC culture method recommended by USEPA for E. coli enumeration and a fluorescent antibody-direct viable count (FA-DVC) method to visualize living E. coli cells with a microscope. Methods and Results: Escherichia coli, faecal coliforms and Enterococcus were detected using standard methods recommended by the USEPA. VBNC E. coli was visualized with FA-DVC. Results were analysed with standard statistical methods (Pearson correlation; paired-sample t-test). Significantly higher numbers of E. coli were detected using the FA-DVC method than using the mTEC method. Escherichia coli results were also compared with faecal coliform (mFC broth) and Enterococcus (mEI agar) counts in the same samples. Conclusions: The results of this comparative study demonstrate that E. coli can be present in higher numbers than what are detected with standard culture methods. Significance and Impact of the Study: This study re-emphasizes the need for a rapid, accurate and precise method for detecting health risks to humans who use recreational waters.},

In this article, the authors propose parameters for select microorganism indicators to assist in the establishment of public-health-based objectives for fresh and marine water quality. A type-II meta-analysis of the results of 18 published epidemiological studies was implemented in an attempt to characterize the relationship(s) between concentrations of bacterial indicators and rates of acute gastrointestinal diseases among bathers who had used fresh or marine water for recreational purposes. The authors fit multiple linear-regression models, which allowed for random effects across studies, to derive dose-response curves. Several confounders and effect modifiers were controlled for in the analyses. Risks were then estimated for a hypothetical individual who would bathe 20 times/yr in water that contained a given concentration of microorganisms. For fresh-water-associated highly credible gastrointestinal illnesses, a level of 10 fecal coliforms/100 ml water yielded an attributable risk of 0.2 cases/1,000 person-years; a risk of 2 cases/1,000 person-years was found for fecal streptococci. The corresponding yearly attributable risks were 1 and 13 cases/1,000 person-years, respectively, for 100 bacteria/100 ml fresh water. Risks associated with fecal coliforms were found to be lower in marine water than in fresh water. Irrespective of the type of water examined, total coliforms were related only weakly with acute digestive morbidity. Developers of future bathing-water standards should state the level of risk deemed acceptable for public health. The authors of this study maintain that levels of fecal coliforms and fecal streptococci should be used as criteria for infectious risk management associated with bodies of marine and fresh water used for recreational purposes.},

The papers are grouped under the following headings: water quality standards and bacterial indicators; oceanographic studies and monitoring of systems; environmental impact studies; modelling of waste disposal systems; submarine outfall design and construction; and cultural, legal and social issues. Some of the topics discussed by the papers are cited as examples: presence of indicators and Salmonella in natural waters affected by outfall wastewater discharges; monitoring of coastal ocean waters receiving wastewaters in the USA: review of two 1990 publications of the USA National Research Council--National Academy of Sciences and National Academy of Engineering; improvement of bathing water quality by reduction of urban outlets: case study for the beach at Rodvig, Denmark; debate on uncertainty in estimating bathing water quality; the concept of the optimum alignment of discharge pipelines due to the minimization of the wave forces; marine disposal of waste water from combined sewerage systems--problems, politics, practicalities; and the reintegration of used waters in the environment. All papers are abstracted separately.},

	annote = {The objectives of this survey made in Thurso Bay, Caithness, Scotland, were to obtain sufficient information on the hydrography of the Bay to determine the optimum offshore discharge points for Thurso sewage with varying degrees of treatment at minimum cost. As the new outfall is within the controlled tidal waters of the Highland River Purification Board, the following recommendations were made to assist with the planning of the survey and the design of the new drainage scheme: no sewage solids should be deposited on Thurso beach; the appearance of the inshore waters should be aesthetically acceptable - the outfall design should be capable of achieving an initial dilution which would minimise the formation of a sewage slick; the new drainage scheme should also be capable of meeting mandatory (EEC) bacteriological standards.},
